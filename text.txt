<Pp><em>"It's completely broken and it seems like it's all your fault."</em></Pp>
<Pp>It's feeling hard to think.</Pp>
<Pp>My name is Jim29, and I'm just a nice typical guy. I suppose every now and then I act kind of funky or say things I shouldn't, but I tend to give 100% when it really counts. I write programs for Dimples, the largest medical zoftware provider in Nowhere Else. I provide a sought-after skill, so I am admittedly affluent, but I don't let that go to my head!</Pp>
<Pp>I speak both confidently and quietly, selecting my words with care: "Is there any way we can just kinda roll back the code? To the earlier version?"</Pp>
<Pp>Nug20 rubs his tired eyes with his hairy fists. "Too late. Too many dependencies."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gotcha. Yah! Understood. What should I be doing right now?"</Pp>
<Pp>Nug20 is my supervisor. He gives me my assignments and I report back to him on my progress. I sit in his workpod when mine workpod feels lonely. I like knowing that he can help me if I run into a problem I can't solve, like this one. He shifts around in his understuffed beanie bag chair and the fabric squeaks like a mouse. He's a senior developer, been working here for like fifteen NiceTime Perfect Years I think, and he knows almost everything there is to know about our code. He talks pretty quiet and seems to make an effort to say as few words as possible. He's always had a bad case of wrist edema, which means he probably lives somewhere near the eastern Big Town aquifer. I know little else about him. Snot pools in a shiny ball underneath his nose, eager to drip. The sun sets behind the black clouds of the horizon, filtered red through the window's particular tint.</Pp>
<Pp>"Find it in the map."</Pp>
<Pp>I step on a stool so I can reach above the dusty cabinets and hoist down the package directory; the cabinets are too high for average person arms to reach above without the assistance of the special stool. This giant honker of a book is bound in smooth green leather and its pages are about as wide as my chest. It's filled with alphabetically listed locations for every single knot in our codebase, each printed in a shrimpy bold font. The tome's burdensome heft makes my stringy triceps shake and burn.</Pp>
<Pp>The scoop is that some jacked up code in one of these knots made it through the testing phase into this morning's release and caused two crashes by lunchtime. It might be an issue with intensity-and-dosage.tangle, the top leaf on the traceback tree, or it might be an issue with a branch it relies on.  But what's especially pertinent is that I made a change a couple NiceTime Perfect Days ago in the section where the error occurred, so I'm in the hot seat here.</Pp>
<Pp>I appreciate Nug20's laconic nature. Most of us talk as much as possible to feel less alone but he seems to have alone pretty under control. Come to think of it, as a verbosity suppression technique, I'll henceforth relay NiceTime Perfect Units in this log as truncated *seconds, *minutes, *days, etc. I know that violates NiceTime's branding or whatever. But out of everyone, shouldn't they particularly understand that our time together is limited? Is that OK with you? I hope that doesn't make you uncomfortable. I can also convert it to a different chronobrand if you'd like. This whole sector uses NiceTime which, if you ask me, has really taken a toll on Big Town. Business Time feels so long and Pleasure Time feels so short. No time for relaxing. Sometimes I can tell when they're dilating the *minutes. Like this one, for instance. Very lengthy.</Pp>
<Pp>I blink hard to wake my eyes up. My fingers moisten the papper and I sip my bubbly Strawbberry Queam. Have you ever tried Queam? I suck down a few canisters of this stuff every *day. It's sticky and gummy and viscous, and every sip is a zippity zappity BURST of fruity flavor that rocks my world. Red ropes of corn syrup congeal against my teeth and I chisel em off with my tongue. "How have the users been?" I crack a hesitant grin. "Are they whining? Throwing tantrums?"</Pp>

<Pp>Nug20's loose brown striped button-down is moist with afternoon sweat. His posture is stiff and his eyebrows knit. He cleans his spectacles gingerly with his sleeve. "We've got conflicting reports, maybe one dead and one in a coma, maybe two flat-out dead."</Pp>
<Pp>My face feels a specific way, almost like it's ready to slip off the side of my head. I'm a nice guy, cross my heart and hope to die. I believe in the Lord and I go to church pretty often. I'm handsome and I'm smart and I'm nice. My grandma always used to say I'm exactly the sort of guy you'd be lucky to know. God though, in an instant I feel smaller than I ever have before. Skyscraper to an anthill. My thoughts go silent, my mouth fills with warm thin nauseous spit.</Pp>
<Pp>"Jesus Christ in heaven! Oh no oh no," I yell. My cheeks are flushed. I look down because I don't want to look up because then he might be looking at me. "Are you trying to make me laugh right now?" I lose my grip on the directory and it drops with a whump.</Pp>
<Pp>"This is not an attempt at humor."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?? How could that happen?" I don't know what to do with my body. I'm staying perfectly still.</Pp>
<Pp>"One was a pacemaker crash. The other was an iron lung crash."</Pp>
<Pp>I slam down my canister and start stress-skimming the pages. He pounds down on his keyboard like it's offended him personally, but that's his normal behavior, he's a pounder. The walls rattle a little bit. I clear my throat, mush some runny phlegm to the side.</Pp>
<Pp>"Why didn't a tester catch this?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The testers have a difficult job. Don't try to shift the blame."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry. That was unbecoming of me. I'm trying my best, I promise. I don't really know how to process this."</Pp>
<Pp>"Focus on fixing the problem, muchacho."</Pp>
<Pp>"When I was a kid and someone told me super bad news like this I'd just sit in my room and scream for *hours."</Pp>
<Pp>"Please don't act like that."</Pp>
<Pp>I feel heavy and my mouth's switched to feeling dry. My pits are swampy with sweat. Ever since I started working here I get these sweats that smell worse than sin. "Did I commit manslaughter or something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Things will be OK."</Pp>
<Pp>He's getting tired of me, I can tell. My words keep leaking. "Did they have kids? That'd be so dam horrible if I killed somebody's parents. That would make me cry, so I'm crossing my toes that that's not the case. Ha ha." I scan the lines with my shaking index finger. "Were they kids? Holy moly...please tell me they weren't kids. Please please <em>please</em> tell me they weren't kids."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jim29, I do not know."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jesus! OH MY GOD!! I'm sorry, this has gotta be some of the worst news I've ever gotten. I'm very sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>He's just staring into at his flashing screen. His eyes look spacey. He wipes his nose.</Pp>
<Pp>I shut my eyes to block out the fluorescent light. My mind is racing. "One of them was in an iron lung? We still support those?"</Pp>
<Pp>"That's pretty messed up of you man. They were a customer." He pushes his glasses up. "They were a human being."  </Pp>
<Pp>I flip to page 1416B and skim for the heading on VORP Requests. "Yah no, I shouldn't have said that. You're totally right."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I never "intended" to work here. I ended up here.</Pp>
<Pp>I went to an employment fair during my last *year at Knowledge Dome, about a </em>month before my ultimate review. I wasn't going to be graduating with a degree that clearly lent itself to work in any certain specific industry so I just wandered kinda listlessly past all the bright foam booths. It was a scorching hot nasty summer *day and the gymnasium was boiling damp. My nice grey unisuit was hanging in a closet in my grandma's house 50 twentyleaps north and I didn't have access to a speedster so I was wearing my least wrinkled button up tucked into my least baggy gym khakis. My hair was combed straight down and gelled into lumps and I trimmed my bushy caterpillar moustache as best as I could. All the other kids were wearing their bright yellow interview shoes. My advisor forgot to forward me the form to order a pair.</Pp>
<Pp>I was trying not to look interested in anything and actively figuring out creative reasons to not work for any of those companies. Deep down I felt profoundly incapable of contributing anything meaningful to my society or my world. Smart, thoughtful, talented, and kind-hearted as I may've been, I was also an arrogantly nervous dude filled to the brim with expensive, worthless, soon-to-be outdated ideas. The rest of the world seemed simultaneously so far above and beneath me.</Pp>
<Pp>A tall woman with sharp eyes stood next to a glossy foam display. Her booth was adorned with a small bowl of violet candy corn and branded pens in a range of calming pastel hues. There was a black box plugged into the wall projecting a hologram of their logo spinning. It was a faded pink D with a baby blue dot in its center. It glowed a little bit too bright.</Pp>
<Pp>"We just recently updated our logo. Do you like it?" she said. She wore a gold pendant in the shape of a pouncing panther. Her smile was wide and impressive.</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, I think it's very striking." I looked up at her and then to the side.</Pp>
<Pp>"Nice to meet you, Jim29 03Goldman! My name is Veronica72 97Snoat." She had dark crispy hair. "I've read all about you on the net."</Pp>
<Pp>We scanned each other's finger data. Her hand was very large and could wrap fully around mine. There was an unmistakable tenderness in her eyes and I felt unnerved looking into them as her fingerprints downloaded onto my mindchip. I stuffed my hands into my pouch immediately afterward. "Uh, so what sort of work do you do at Dimples?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I see you didn't do your homework!" She smiled and rubbed her lips together. She had made her voice big and loud, like a humorous voice. "We're an enormous medical technology company."</Pp>
<Pp>"Like for records? Book-keeping, and stuff?"</Pp>
<Pp>She leaned her head from side to side. "Close," she widened her eyes, like I really was very close, "but actually hmm...no cigar. We sell a monthly subscriptional program that nearly every medical device in the nation runs on." She handed me a pink folder with a blue pamphlet inside.</Pp>
<Pp>"How does that all work?"</Pp>
<Pp>She had long eyelashes and deep wrinkles around her smile lines. "The devices we support are 'smart' and completely net-enabled. We design their functionality and user interfaces. When people get sick, their well-being becomes our responsibility. Do you want to save someone's life, Jim29?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, sure."</Pp>
<Pp>"Good. Cuz we save the lives of billions of people every *day."</Pp>
<Pp>"Cool. That's super awesome." The bottoms of my brown dress shoes felt sticky against the floor. I kept stealing glances over at the hologram. "So do the devices have, like, extra functionality cuz of the zoftware?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Certainly. All of our devices are locked into an invisible global network that spans coast to coast. Even though the zoftware is buried deep down in the hard drives of the machines, they're able to communicate with each other from very far away."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gotcha, OK. So they're like, online?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. Patients are also given the choice to instantly publish the results of their procedures on social media, for instance."</Pp>
<Pp>I flipped through the pamphlet. It had a very minimal design. The papper was thick and smooth, kind of leathery. "What languages do you use? I don't have a lot of experience."</Pp>
<Pp>"We use immutable Tangle 40.0.3 for our back end programming. The interface is all written in our special version of FlashScript. We call it DimpleScript, he he!" She furiously scribbled on her notepad. The friction made a squealy scratching sound.</Pp>
<Pp>"Is it OK if I haven't done much programming? I only used a little bit of FlashScript in one of my microlessons."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes! Why are you underselling yourself?" For a fraction of a *second her eyes bored through mine, deep into my sensitive noodle brain. But then she smiled. "I'm sure you'll get the hang of it. You'll pick it up quick. You're a star, Jim29! We're looking for people just like you."</Pp>
<Pp>The interview process was relatively painless. I can't really complain. In my first interview they made me wear a weighted vest like you wear when they snap images of your bones and they tested to see how quickly I could escape a maze. In my second interview they made me wear a blindfold and took me underground and had me answer questions about my personality in the middle of what sounded like a large empty stadium. I really didn't enjoy hearing my wispy voice echo back to me off the walls of that cavernous interior. I got an offer the next Activeday.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>"Are VORPs enabled by a knob?" I thumb through a table of knob locations.</Pp>
<Pp>Nug85 has fast fingers that blur when they're in motion. He scuffs his mouse around on a rubbery custom-printed mousepad of his smiling family. "Yes it's a private knob."</Pp>
<Pp>We use the Variable On Request Protocol to securely transmit polite queries to our internal data steward, which prefers to be called "Deward." VORPs are fairly troublesome to work with. To protect sensitive data, the protocol handles runtime errors by powering off its operating device, which seems a bit overboard to me quite frankly. I brush some snack dust out from underneath my spacebar. Sometimes it piles up under there and makes the key crunchy. The stillness is unbearable. I begin to chat. "Hey um, have you been watching much teevee lately?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Couple *hours every night before rest."</Pp>
<Pp>"What sorta stuff do you watch?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Mainly live cams of active wars transpiring across the land."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ah, I see. How've those been going?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Some better than others. You ought to check Drip, by the way."</Pp>
<Pp>"You really think the crashes got on Drip?" I turn the page. The page is as long as my torso.</Pp>
<Pp>"No reason they wouldn't."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hm. Yes. OK. Well, I think the tangle file I'm looking for is in the precompiled local templates folder, or /bin/app/lib/custom/secure/v1/local/. I should totally be able to get to the bottom of this. Should be a quick fix!! I'm going to really really quick go grab my computerior." I get up from my beany bag. "I think I might stop by the Belly actually. Want me to grab you a snack? A gooey cornbread muffin maybe?"</Pp>
<Pp>He looks up at me. His expression is tranquil. "I have no use for a muffin."</Pp>
<Pp>The whole east wing is in a buzz. Employees are furiously flipping through documents and highlighting certain lines and then closing them. Chadmuth48 23Shnozo is trying to get my attention. He's the head media guy. He hollers "Jim29!" and waves with his whole body.</Pp>
<Pp>I lean against his desk. It is covered in high-gloss printouts of online articles. "How's it going, my freaky nutjob?"</Pp>
<Pp>He reclines in his hammock with a steaming ramekin of sticky water. Chadmuth48 likes his sticky water to be particularly cohesive. It jiggles to and fro. "Why'd you call me a freaky nutjob?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry. Thought it would be a fun thing to call you. My bad."</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't sweat it. I mean literally! Your pits stink really bad."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh. Ha ha. I didn't realize everyone else can smell em too."</Pp>
<Pp>"Have you checked Drip yet bud?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Not yet, I'm walking to go get my computering device though actually, I need to get working."</Pp>
<Pp>I like Chadmuth48. He has a great energy to be around. He's the kind of guy who gives lots of hard back pats, the kind that really thwap. His whole being is rigidly animated; his limbs don't move, they snap. The whites of his eyes are abundant and his bleached blond hair is gelled back. He was appointed as Chief Consumer Perception Director just a few *weeks ago after a long stint as an administrator at a corp called Brandometry. He says good morning to me in the halls and he always remembers my name. I don't know him very well but he speaks to me with the candor of a sympathetic friend. "It's not good dude. It's not good at all."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh shoot. How bad?" I walk around behind his monitor to take a peek.</Pp>
<Pp>"It's been dripped almost forty frickin times." Posts from all across the nation map quickly scroll down across his Ultradef screen, forming a never-ending stream. The Ultradef technology enhances the letters, making them bulbously pop out in three-dimensional space, glowing in every magnificent hue of the spectrum, ultraviolet to infrared. "In the biz we'd say it's making a real splash, if you're snatchin up what I'm slammin down."</Pp>
<Pp>One of the drips trickling down is a gallery of two livestreams. The left stream shows a man with his eyes closed, laying down, motionless, almost peaceful. The right shows a family wailing and grieving in the hospital with no sound. The post reads:</Pp>
<Pp>[NewsNEWSjc$d*] > TWO DEAD cuz of crashing Dimples [Dimples:)] zoftware? DOINK! Subscribe for more updates.</Pp>
<Pp>It descends off the screen in a wink.</Pp>
<Pp>"Dang alright. This is really really bad, right? How many people do you think have seen it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The most recent Drip update made it so everyone sees all the drips." His voice is gravelly. "That was a big part of Drip 9.4 Focus," which he says like it's something I should know, duh.</Pp>
<Pp>"So you think every single living person saw it?"</Pp>
<Pp>It's one thing to know you've done something insanely terrible, and a completely different thing to know that everyone else knows also. I get freaked out if I think too much about what people think of me. I want to be considered strictly fondly!</Pp>
<Pp>The room is distractingly cold, but that's just how the media folks like it. I cross my arms and gaze through the glass floor. The folks a floor below us argue around shiny tables.</Pp>
<Pp>"Well some people probably weren't looking at their screens. But I'd estimate at least...half of everyone." Chadmuth48 has thin eyebrows set high above his eyes. He raises them even higher. "It's a pretty sexy, savory scoop."</Pp>
<Pp>"What happens next? Are you drafting up a statement?" I swallow too much scrumptious red Queam and dribble a little down my chin. "I wanna help any way I can."</Pp>
<Pp>"Calm down bigshot. Take a deep breath. We're figuring it out." He smiles and stares me right in the eyes. His are bloodshot. Sometimes it looks like his pupils flicker back and forth. His nose is miniature and angular. His breathing is a quiet wheeze.</Pp>
<Pp>My concentration evaporates into the ambient din of chatter, footsteps, and clacking keys. There's a churning in my belly. "Two people who can never wake up. Two lives integrally linked with the lives of countless others. Two nodes ripped out of a sprawling networks of souls. Two coffins, y'know? Maybe they go somewhere else, or maybe it's only cold, black, endless death. I just find it hard to imagine."</Pp>
<Pp>"Everyone gets snuffed out at some point." He tucks his shirt in and sits up straighter. He's wearing a silky tight baby blue work blouse buttoned down two and a half buttons. The veins on his knuckles are sizable.</Pp>
<Pp>I re-cross my arms an alternate way. "I'm pretty sure some people just die."</Pp>
<Pp>"Baloney. It's always something. The flu. A cold. Heart problems, cancer, a stroke, a speedster crash, an aneurysm. Never 'old age.'" He does the finger quotes. "The devil doesn't drag you away for no reason."</Pp>
<Pp>I gnaw on my lower lip. "I don't think I'm a huge fan of that idea."</Pp>
<Pp>"Two billion people die every *day, my pal. Isn't it terrific that you're one of the ones still kicking? Maybe instead of thinking about ideas you should be working on that bug that killed those suckas." He takes a sip of his tea. "Don't worry, I'm being playfully facetious. It's not your fault. Or if it was, so what? At least you're still here! Keep your chin up high. Don't crucify yourself, nahmean? But also you do really need to fix this."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes, definitely. You're really, really correct."</Pp>
<Pp>He raises his eyebrows even higher and grins. "Good news though: this sort of thing should qualify you for another Happy Splash!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Really? I already got splashed this morning."</Pp>
<Pp>"I've heard they'll give you a Tragedy Bonus Splash."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's really cool. Super amazingly awesome. Wow!"</Pp>
<Pp>I march my way from the east wing of the office to the central hub. Along the way I load up TroughDaddy, my scoop app of choice. I simply tap my favorite feeds, and it loads them straight into my celly.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm a media maniac, so I get hungry for new scoops every few *hours or so. They're so much fun. Each scoop is a tiny little tidbit to keep me aware, a mini snapshot of our world in motion. I also have to admit, they've made me much more caring and empathetic. I understand the suffering that happens in this country because I read about it on my celly.</Pp>
<Pp>At this instant, my top scoops are: Eleven Completely Mind-Blasting Facts About Angels and Perfect Nightmare Bomb Dropped On Jungle Rebels. BLAM!

<Pp>When the BizOps team makes a sale, the whole building is notified. The overhead intercom speakers make a loud crunchy cash register noise, like "ch-ching!" Anyways, it's been ch-chinging a lot today. I'll be logging them henceforth.</Pp>
<Pp>My desk is all the way up in the Neck. I climb into the mouth of an escalator slide and lie down with my arms at my sides. The inside of the slide is dark and red and warm and it makes me feel safe. The structure gently pulses and makes a gurgling noise. Closing my eyes, I feel my back rub across the plastic and the heartbeat in my head.</Pp>

<Pp>Dimples offered me a hundred and twenty ingots of gold for a starting salary. I argued them up to a hundred and fifty ingots on account of the cost of living in a metropolitan area. I probably could've asked for five or ten ingots on top of that but I was nervous I'd come across like a selfish greedy goblin prince. Their benefits package included body insurance covering punctures and smacks (a smack is defined as a "doink" or a "bonk"), armed and unarmed robbery insurance, kidnapping insurance, poisoning insurance (does not cover venomous incidents), and complimentary access to an underground swimming pool, which would be nice if I knew how to swim.</Pp>
<Pp>I splurged for a one bedroom cubby on the two hundred twelfth floor of a skyrise called ThrivePlex,, billed as a "Top Notch Home-Esque Experience For The Discerningly Affluent Lad Or Lass" and located a convenient 10 twentyleaps from the Dimples Big Town headquarters. (In case you're unfamiliar with neocolonial units, 1 twentyleap = 900 leaps, 2.5 zoomers, or 300 kilocybermeters) The room came with some unusual amenities, such as lights that make the tap water glow violet, a bathroom fog machine, and numerous very wide and slightly smudged mirrors. Try as I might, I have yet to dispel the building's peculiar unignorable stench.</Pp>
<Pp>The view from the living room is mostly just the cloudy sky, other reflectively bone white skyscrapers, and a cluster of choo choo rails that operate on alternating schedules. The red rail is owned by Kwikkie Ride, the blue rail is owned by Zoomster, the yellow rail is owned by CheapFast Chugga, and the green rail is owned by  You'd be shocked how fast those choo choos move, ha. ThrivePlex is smack dab in the middle of the southern Big Town train district. Five separate paths of private railway run past my window at different angles. Every couple *hours they rumble the walls as they zap by. They're so bright and fast. I can't see the passengers through the tinted windows but I'm sure they can see me, standing in my big t-shirt and smiley face boxers. They leave behind acrid clouds of smoke.</Pp>
<Pp>The *day I moved in I found a pink and blue packet on the counter. I leaned my jellybed against the wall and unsealed the packet with my forefinger.</Pp>
<Pp>Inside was a letter that read:</Pp>
<Pp><em>Dear Mr. 03Goldman,</em></Pp>
<Pp><em>We here at Dimples could not be any more excited for you to join us. Boo-yah! The mere idea of it makes our mouths water.

<Pp>I knock the knocker and buzz the buzzer. Dr. Rocko19 85Grinski, my Happy Splash Specialist, answers the door to his 6th floor private cavern. He wears a flowy floral tunic and a crown of artificial posies, complementing his striking green eyes and flowing brown hair. "Jim29?" He asks in thinly-veiled surprise. His bright smile reaches all the way around his skull. "Back so soon?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah doc, so here's the scoop, I think my code might have killed two innocent people."</Pp>
<Pp>He swings the door open. His chambers are lit with the glow of charcoal burning in wall-mounted sconces. The floor beneath my boots is obscured by a collection of vibrant, culturally ambiguous rugs. His bountiful eyebrows curl skyward. "You're here for your Tragedy Bonus Splash, I assume?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, I was wondering if I might qualify for that extra Bonus Splash. Chadmuth48 was telling me about that."</Pp>
<Pp>He rests his dry thumb against my forehead for about ten *seconds.</Pp>
<Pp>"Your temperature is elevated and you're perspiring. Your mind is teeming with pathetic screams of worry. Morally, I feel obligated to splash you."</Pp>
<Pp>I bend my torso downward as a display of deference. "Thank you Dr. Grinski."</Pp>
<Pp>He thrusts my head and neck down into the tub of gooey pink Happy fluid. I didn't get enough of a breath and I flounder in the bubbling depths, feeling my pores swell up as the positive chemicals seep in. I instinctively thrash my arms and legs, choking on my lack of air, feeling his hands dunk me deeper. He slams my face against against the metallic basin of the tub and I feel my nose cartilage crunch. The rosy solution slides down my throat and into my lungs.</Pp>
<Pp>He yanks me up by my dripping disc of hair. "You feel better, dumbass?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I feel so outrageously good. I love you."</Pp>

<Pp>The headquarters of Dimples are globular in shape, like a droplet of oil on a flat surface. Its husk is composed of glass tinted a deep red. On any given *day you can see the silhouettes of people working their hardest inside. The east wing is connected to a monstrous parking deck and remote sections of the campus are accessible via an old tram system.The front lawn is verdant and neat; in the nasty summer you bet I'd sit and eat out on the grass, weather permitting. The green dewy blades are made of a spongy polymer fiber; nowadays they're frozen solid and crunchy to step on. There're never any critters or ants or even birds in the area. Just plastic green reaching out so far below the black cloudy heavens. It's very silent and very still.</Pp>
<Pp>The foyer upon entrance is cavernous! I practically gasped out loud the first time I saw it. The floors and walls are grey marble and the ceiling transparent, showing a view of the floor above but mostly the undersides of people's dumb old shoes. A marble desk pokes out of the floor in the center of the room for the secretary to sit at. When I arrived ten *minutes early to my first interview she opened the entrance hatch and gave me a great big handshake. I couldn't make out the name on her name badge. She bubbled over with enthusiasm. "Thank you so much for coming sir! It's so wonderful to meet you! We are super excited!" She directed me to sit on a flat bench and left the room. She didn't come back. I had to use my own intuition to figure out where to go. That's just how it dang ol goes at Dimples. Sometimes I wonder if the bewildering moments of disorganization are, in reality, intricately plotted tests of character. No way to know for sure, but probably not. Big curly blue cursive letters on the foyer's back wall read "Be your finest. Think the loudest."</Pp>
<Pp>The door on the right leads to one of the many slide rooms in the complex. It's special, though, cuz it has up and down slides for every floor, which is super convenient in a pinch. The floor is smooth tile and the ceiling see-through glass. In the mornings around 9 the room gets stuffed with people packed shoulder to shoulder warm and waiting to slide up to their pods. I like standing in that morning mass, listening as everyone quietly whispers to each other about their daily tasks. Every so often if the wait gets to be too long some folks start shoving. It's best not to stand in the middle of the crowd!</Pp>
<Pp>The first floor bathrooms are the cleanest in the building but they're still covered in putty and wizz.</Pp>

<Pp>"Putty" is slang of recent vintage. It means doo doo. Folks around here eat a lot of genetically modified corn, and the corn contains a lot of really complicated fibres that tummies can't digest, so our feces comes out rubbery and sticky. Hence, putty.</Pp>
<Pp>The initially-cream ceramic flooring is stained yellow and always caked with fresh warm man mud. It's like walking into a large intestine. At least one of the three stalls is always clogged with a mountain of dung and soiled RearWipe Gelpads. When you've got this many guys in a single building it's normal for the men's restroom to be kind of cruddy, but it still gets on my nerves a little. Some employees flush the urinals over and over until they overflow. They laugh and whistle and push popping wet putties onto the floor and to make matters worse, they stomp em into the tile. I guess I just sometimes wish there were a restroom available where that sort of nonsense wouldn't be allowed. But I get that's it's entirely within their legal right to play with their own chocolate pies, and I do appreciate that there's always a path you can follow to avoid stepping on anything solid. Might be hard to believe, but by my second *week there I'd gotten used to it; I bury my nose in my elbow and have my own special technique for wiping clumps off the toilet seat. Plus, the soap stocked in the dispenser has a really nice lavender fragrance and the hand dryers are the kind that blow hot air really fast.</Pp>
<Pp> The door on the left leads to the company gym. Its window are always fogged up with bodily steam. If it's quiet you can hear the yells and grunts through the walls. The people that work out in the gym are all at least a leap taller than me. They have hard, tough bodies always glistening with sweat. I wonder how it'd feel to be like that. What does it feel like to be a big guy? Once I stopped in and watched as they pulled on long ropes that glowed primary colors and jutted out of the floor, walls, and ceiling. They shook on their feet as the ropes pulled back. They winced as rivulets of sweat dripped down their faces. The walls and floors rumbled with energy. Their muscles screamed and spasmed, ready to pop off of their arms and legs. Their expressions were contorted in shapes of pure agony.</Pp>
<Pp>The double doors on the back wall lead into the garden atrium. The grass is always soft and recently cut, and some of the only organic stuff I've found in the region. Must've been a big investment. They also have an apple tree, a cherry tree, and an orange tree, but those are plastic. A picnic table's situated between em and a babbling stream runs through a pile of rocks. The table was recently painted white and it's never given me a splinter. The curved walls render a vibrant vista of cloudless blue skies and rolling hills. The water gurgles and the artificial breeze whistles. The path of small pebbles is lined with lilies. No one ever goes in there much.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The slide drops me off on the fifth floor, AKA "The Neck." My brain feels tremendous, like a comet across the cloudy sky. That splash did me a world of good. Everything will be OK, it seems like. I'm safe, and that's all that matters, yes? Right on!!</Pp>
<Pp>I walk into the bathroom and heave into the toilet a few times. Throat lurches but nuthin comes up. My horrible wheezing coughs reverberate through my abnormally warm skull. The pressure makes my eyes moist. My whole neck spasms and my nose drips snot onto a mountain of crumpled wet cruddy RearWipe Gelpads at the bottom of the bowl. I wonder how all my old friends everywhere elsewhere are feeling in their own distinct separate lives and I really miss them. Are they feeling the same as me? Do our feelings even have the same texture and tone? What percentage of them will I ever talk to again? They'll see me in the news now, they'll unforget me. Wish it were under different circumstances. If I'm lucky, maybe they'll reach out and ask me how I'm doing. I'd love to hear from them again.</Pp>
<Pp>I sit up on the toilet seat and shiver, holding my breath from the smell. I have a lot to be grateful for. I am buzzing with pure fluid gratitude. Palms pressed together, the words flow.</Pp>
<Pp>"Heavenly father, you have blessed me with such bountiful abundance. I know not how I could ever truly repay you, but I know--"</Pp>
<Pp>(There is grunting and splashing in the stall to my left. The subsequent smell stinks almost impossibly.)</Pp>
<Pp>"--in my heart, which you designed just for me, that the only payment you accept is love. Please forgive me of my sins as I strive to more closely follow the path--"</Pp>
<Pp>(There is laughter from the left stall. A gravelly voice barks "Fart so hard my buttcheeks almost rip.")</Pp>
<Pp>"--of righteousness, and shield me from evil within the warmth of your wings. Amen."</Pp>
<Pp>Outside, my workpod is situated between a wall and a load bearing column, right underneath a toasty heat vent. A circular window in my pod lets some light in but it's slightly too high up for me to peer through it comfortably. Mostly it creates a bunch of glare for my computering device's screen. The tinted glass shell of the building renders everything outside too dark and too red to make out. My inner desk is a mess and I'm pretty ashamed of it if I'm being totally honest. It's piled up with treat wrappers, snotty balled-up tissues, empty Queam canisters, plastic bags, crumbs, soiled bandages, gold hunks, branded pens, colorful squishy toys, print-outs of a few online articles, and a glass terrarium one of my friends sent me with a plastic succulent inside that I named Genius. I'm not a messy person, I just have a very hard and stressful job, and almost all experts agree that it's normal to accumulate a bit of clutter. My personal computering device has a long, sturdy screen roughly the size and shape of a surfboard, and its keys are illuminated with multisegmented efficiency glyphs. When I sit at my desk I leave it hooked up to my monitor, which has a state-of-the-art razor-thin curved Ultradef screen that wraps halfway around my head. My stool squawks as I roll it into sitting position. One of the custodians must have forgotten to grease its axles. That's the third time this *week. I'll have to submit a report. The cushion feels great when I plop my big booty down on it.</Pp>
<Pp>The ceiling in my workpod is opaque but the floor is transparent. Sometimes when I'm bored I'll take a little break to gaze down at the guy who works below me. He never seems to notice me looking. Unless the aerial angle is deceptive, he's a rather tall man. His brown hair is buzzed very short and he wears the same grey unisuit every *day. He looks very skinny and bony and his desk is covered in treat wrappers.  I looked him up in the public employee directory a while ago. It had so much information! His name is Rony22 95Barnard. He works as the Assistant Chairman for the Managerial Executive Sub-Council on Inter- and Intradepartmental Affairs. He's 57 *years old. He is single and childless. He's been working at Dimples for more than twenty *years. He's never been promoted. His greatest fear is megabacteria. His blood type is Z negative. He spends his whole *day pacing in circles around the perimeter of his workpod. The walls of his pod are all covered in the same weird tan fabric. Every now and then he'll suffer a tantrum, during which he turns bright red and shoves whatever furniture is closest to him, causing much crashing and clatter as he sucks down huge breaths, beating the side of his head with his fist, shouting "NO! STUPID! NO! NO! NO!"</Pp>
<Pp>But today seems to be a good *day for Rony22. I don't have much to report. He is seated in his shiny chair, speaking into his great big microphone, smiling wide. Not very interesting. Staring time is over.</Pp>
<Pp>I look back up at my pulsating screen. I unfocus my eyes, limpen my muscles, and raise my heavy brows. I reimagine the scope of the world, my place in it, and how high up the sky is from the ground. I exist in a world without discrete data. Everything is meaninglessly relative if you get right down to it. My brain feels snuggled beneath a cranial quilt. I snap open a canister of Banannna Queam and it whistles out some fizz. God will understand that it's not my fault.</Pp>
<Pp>I thinkscribe a drip and drop it.</Pp>
<Pp>[Mr Jim29 That'sme((] > How's everybody doing today? I'm feeling quite bodacious ha ha! Hit me up if you want to hang tonight. I'm going to be chilling out at home!</Pp>
<Pp>Not my best drip ever, but still decent. Hopefully it'll get a few thumbs or maybe even a flip. Ten trillion people will see it, but only twelve or so will actually read it. There's no way to keep up with it all, so people are selective with what they read. To be brutally honest, I'm not very popular on the net. I don't have that talent, that dazzle, that x-factor, that star power, that reach, that brand recognition. Strangers only read my writing on accident.</Pp>
<Pp>Jumper56 81Diaz is walking in my general direction, but not really looking at me. She furiously two-finger tap taps her celly screen's virtual keys. She says "Hey mister fella!" and taps me on the shoulder. She's wearing her hard hat; she's always wearing her hard hat. She is my office friend. Her workpod is across from mine, and it is much cleaner. She came here after getting fired from a developer role at Pinkslip, a company that designs custom simbots optimized to be very good and very friendly at firing people. I always really enjoy conversation with her. She's able to figure out what makes every single stinking thing sparkle. She occasionally glances up, briefly making eye contact, still typing. "Would you mind if I tried to make you laugh?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Go for it."</Pp>
<Pp>"I was imagining earlier today how it would be if you were an astronaut, and like, you landed on a great big asteroid just fine, and you're in your asteroid space home on your very first night sleeping there, and you, then you realize while you're like getting ready for bed that you left all your own dam pajamas back on earth."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ha ha. I think I get it."</Pp>
<Pp>Her curly dark hair is tied up in a bun beneath her hat. She has freckles. We chat a lot over zoip. I'm impressed by her amiable attitude. "You do think that's kinda funny??"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. That would stink! I think that's pretty good."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ha ha ha. By the way! Do you think the meeting in forty *minutes is officially mandatory?" Sometimes she says the last few words of a sentence a little slowly for added emphasis.</Pp>
<Pp>I pick up my computerior. "Last I heard it was postponed until tomorrow."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh is that so?" She stretches the sleeves of her foam sweater so they cover her typing knuckles. She hums quiet intervals between thoughts.</Pp>
<Pp>I scratch the back of my neck. I'm not sure how much she's heard. I don't know what she'll think. I select my words with nervous care. "I deployed some new code yesterday and apparently a bug popped up."</Pp>
<Pp>She winces. I'm not sure if it's because of what I said or maybe she read something on her celly that was bad. She's still tapping away. Must be typing a really long message. She glances back up.  "Ah, what in tarnation, y'know. But does it seem like it'll be all tricky to fix?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm not sure. I don't want to talk about it anymore actually. Sorry. Have you been having a good *day?" I exhale slowly.</Pp>
<Pp>"I would say that mine has been really good, thank a bunch for asking."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, no sweat. You know what I've been thinking about? How come we never got wings."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do ya mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm just saying the world would be much safer if we had wings. We could traverse treacherous terrain as if it weren't a big thing."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, I do suppose that is true."</Pp>
<Pp>"We're the apex predator! We can kill anything we want. We evolved to generate critical thoughts. We have the words to describe the size of existence. We're the only organism that launches rockets to blow stuff up. Why can't we fly?"</Pp>
<Pp>She frowns politely. "We'll just never be winged."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ya think maybe God wanted to keep us on the ground?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hm."</Pp>
<Pp>"Down in the muck and the mire or whatever."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. Seems like it."</Pp>
<Pp>"By the way, I was thinking I'd swing by the Belly. Do you want me to grab you a bowl of flakes, or even something else? Doesn't have to be flakes."</Pp>
<Pp>"I think I'm fine without, but it's so nice of you to ask!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course! I'll see ya later."</Pp>
<Pp>"You will do a marvelous job at fixing that bug."</Pp>
<Pp>"Thanks, I value your faith in me."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I just realized that you don't know what I look like. Allow me to amend that! I promise this information was not intentionally withheld. The truth is, in terms of my appearance, I look like a normal, nice young man. I'm kind of short, but I'm actually not insecure about my height. My eyes are little emeralds, and in the daytime I wear a pair of lenses that make the pupils look wider so I fit in with the rest of the guys. My skin is smooth and white, like the outside of a standard toilet. My hair is blond and shaved into a thin ring that circles the edge of my skull. This is a popular Big Town hairstyle; around here they call it "the disc." It's a chic, flirty cut that exudes a uniquely evocative panache. My arms are as thick as my legs, and my legs are almost as thick as Queam canisters. The way my eyebrows are naturally arched frequently makes people ask me "Is everything OK?" and I always tell them yes of course. Everything is great, thanks. Various warts and cysts riddle the space between my nape and my tush. I've got a funny round tummy and I like to make it talk.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>Most of the code I write for Dimples is in Tangle. Tangle is a programming language that was first developed and used around the same time as ancient languages like Parsnip, ZippityZap, BIZ_NIT, and Scuzz. Its syntax is imperative, procedural, strictly typed, and written in all caps. Though the language was initially used to redesign and liven up the displays in early space shuttles and rockets, it remains a common choice for programming consumer electronics. Tangle files or "tangles" are grouped together in swollen packed folders referred to as "knots."  </Pp>
<Pp>The oddest feature that Tangle offers is the possibility for one variable to embody multiple states at once. A variable called HEIGHT could register as 3 when accessed by one function and 5 when accessed by another. Philosophically, this functionality is based on the concept of AnekƒÅntavƒÅda, which translates roughly as "many-sidedness". In the Jainist belief system this idea is explained through the parable of the blind men and the elephant. According to the story, six blind men were asked to describe an elephant. They all touched different parts of the beast and compared notes. The one who touched the trunk thought the elephant was a tree, the one who touched its tusk though it was some sort of pipe, etc. Point is all of them were sort of right but none of them were completely right. In human communication we can write the same words, but we each have our own particular dictionaries. All data is subjective, and so are the variables in Tangle. Only issue is they all share global scope.</Pp>

<Pp>"I'm having trouble replicating the bug."  I straighten my shirt and shift my weight on the beanie bag. I'm feeling pretty down and bad about myself. It's so hard to focus on my work. I can think of way too much to think about. I trace functions calling other functions, instantiating reference models that sort through bundles of streams of function references, looping around and around like a whirly wheel, so many structures operating in fragile dependent tandem. I've been tracking the metadata of a VORP request through an especially wrinkly equality matrix. As variables equal-bounce from node to node they leave behind a unique trail.</Pp>
<Pp>The glyphs are blending together and I'm mostly just scrolling. It's hard to carefully follow the flow of logic when its ramifications could very well possibly include another human death any *second now and I'm sweating like a bovine. My eyes unfocus to the ticking of the clock.</Pp>
<Pp>Here's a confession: I'm not very good at this. I can do this, I'm able to do this, but this is really not what I'm good at. I know it's my job and all but I'm not some sort of talented brain wizard expert.</Pp>
<Pp>I was never allowed to play with building blocks as a kid. They were banned in my whole neighborhood. The local diocese was uncomfortable with how easily kids, upon succumbing to their darker whims, could erect them into pagan obelisks. I never learned good spatial reasoning. I can't twist a 3D shape around in my head and understand how it looks from all angles. I can't visualize complex data models or simulate sequences of logical decisions without making my head feel hot. Why should I have to think that way? Other critters don't have to. I wish I was some kind of species where I could just fly around and eat bugs all *day. Now wouldn't that be nice actually?</Pp>
<Pp>My tone is skeptical: "Are you totally 100% sure they were running the most recent version?"</Pp>
<Pp>Nug20 nods. "Both crashes transpired less than four *hours after updating."</Pp>
<Pp>I drag a window for an electrocardiogram simulation in circles on my screen. The heartbeats are following the right rhythm. Th-thump, th-thump, th-thump. Much slower than mine, but chances are I'm hyper. Sometimes the beats per *minute increase to simulate the bot patient getting excited or agitated. This simbot is named Cormy__ __Shnabbett, age 63, a short hairy old man with a heart problem. It's sitting on a bench in the sun, squinting to watch a blockbuster film on his celly. I'm trying to blink an eyelash out of my eye. I feel empty and fainty and kinda like there's a thin layer of sticky transparent crud covering my skin. "Everything looks fine so far."</Pp>
<Pp>Nug20 doesn't look up. He continues hammering away at his keys. They have dynamite haptic feedback and rumble the table each time they're pressed. Each tap sounds like the tiniest thunderstorm. When he's really concentrating he makes little rhythmic grunting noises under his breath. His hair is long and greasy and hangs down past his shoulders. It thins as it reaches the top of his head, where he's bald for a three inch radius. His cheeks are long and dangly, and the shape of his skull is clearly visible. I don't know where he worked before this role. I don't know much about him at all. But I'm aware that he has no intention to respond. He won't say a word.</Pp>
<Pp>I receive a zoip from Jumper56. In case you're wondering, that "zoip" acronym stands for "Zero Overhead Interchange [Proprietary]." It's the main chat protocol we use around here.</Pp>
<Pp>jumper56ok : howdy!! would you be able to help me with a little snag i'm having?</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : sure what's the snag?</Pp>
<Pp>jumper56ok : i'm getting some kind of weird ERR::DisequalizedIntToInt thing now all of a sudden</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : oh, that just means one of your numbers is set to another number.</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : like the interpreter thinks  5 = 9 or something like that.</Pp>
<Pp>jumper56ok : oh ok. so how do i fix it then?</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : you need to trace the error trail</Pp>

<Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : yah, we'll work on it tomorrow</Pp>
<Pp>jumper56ok : sick. thanks</Pp>
<Pp>Nug20 continues his silence. I'm tired and hopeless. The sky is dark. A thin bit of light peeks through the smoky clouds and dances on the glistening lawn. Nug20's nameplate is etched in a stately white serif letters against a maroon background. They read NUGZORD20 43DUNC - TECHNO FREEK."</Pp>
<Pp>He does a slight frown whenever he's thinking hard. He squints at his screen. "I got pulled over by the GOTCHA! Guys last night."</Pp>
<Pp>"Is that right?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Speedster's rump didn't shut right, was slamming up and down when I was going over bumps. Folks behind me must've spied some of the tools I got back there."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh gosh. How'd it go?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Guys let me off with a warning tattoo. They're laughing, slamming my face against the hood. I'm 32 *years old, you know? I have kids. And that needle's hot."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jeez, nuthin but jeez. That's so bad. I'm really sorry to hear that." I'm not sure what to say. He's never mentioned his tools before. "I'm glad that you're OK."</Pp>
<Pp>He presses the spacebar four times in a row. His throat bump rolls up and down like he's swallowing. He coughs like he's summoning a loogie. "Not any big deal or nuthin."</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : are you doing anything tonight ?</Z>

<Z d={1} u="">~ : to celebrate tweensies! you're invited =:~)</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : wow very cool !!</Pp>
<Pp>Everybody within about a three sector radius celebrates this cool holiday called Tweensies. As nasty winter shifts into nasty summer, there's about a <em>week of fantastic warm sweet temperatures, and amidst this tween time a great merriment can be shared. This *year Tweensies starts on Activeday. I'm pretty pumped.</Pp>
<Pp>"Nug20, I'm not making any progress." I shiver atop my beany bag. "At this point I think I'm just gonna put out a hotfix first thing tomorrow morning."</Pp>
<Pp>He looks over at me. "You can't put out a fix tonight?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I poked around through all of the VORP Requests. None of them were throwing errors. I've read through the lines I modified in the update three times already. It doesn't make any sense. I don't know what more to do."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sometimes, you must quadruple duple check."</Pp>
<Pp>"I really have to go home and feed my birds."</Pp>
<Pp>He's taken aback. "You're serious?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I would never let them go hungry."</Pp>
<Pp>A short pause. Clacking keys.</Pp>
<Pp>He pushes his glasses up again. "Can I ask you something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you want out of life?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hmm, I don't know. I'm sorry. I'll think about it and get back to you. I'm trying really hard to do the right thing."</Pp>
<Pp>"I know how this goes, Jim29. Listen to me." He's being so scoldy right now. His eyes bug out of their sockets. "This will not be good. You are making a big mistake."</Pp>
<Pp>I stuff my computering device into my bag. "I'm sorry. I wish I could keep working. I really have to go."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>What do you love, Jim29? Grandma always said keep in mind what you love. You love God, yes you do, your father who art in heaven. You love the air, you love the floor, you love the ceiling, you love the fields and oceans and streets (and all their names too), you love falling asleep, you love smiling, you love crying, you love feeling like you're getting smarter, you love feeling a cool breeze, you love playing with your toys, you love to go on a walk for a while, that's for sure. Not good enough. You love getting comfortable, you love getting in a huffy fit, you love to stay up all night on Modestday reading the news, you love to take a putty in the afternoon, you love to wake up early on Activeday morning and sit with your birds and bake bread for them and hear all the new things they've learned how to say, you love to walk inside from the cold. Not good enough. You love feeling held, you love being alone, you love God, yes you do, you totally love me too. NOT...</Pp>
<Pp>NOT...</Pp>
<Pp>OK.</Pp>
<Pp>Yes OK.</Pp>
<Pp>You are going to be alright,</Pp>

<Pp>It's the middle of nasty winter and the outside sucks the wind out of my chest. It's been in the negative twenties since December but it's just broken into the negative thirties. My eyes get stiffer the longer I'm outside. Blood's left my extremities and I can't feel my toes. I left my speedster in section A2 southwest. I try to think about being cozy-warm and home. It's about a nine *minute walk.</Pp>
<Pp>Still walking.</Pp>
<Pp>Almost there!</Pp>
<Pp>"Good evening, Tulip."</Pp>
<Pp>That's my speedster's preferred name. It has big round cheeks, long floppy ears, and a light, boyish voice that reverberates within its cabin. It lifts its sleepy eyes and smiles. "Good evening, Jim29! I love you."</Pp>
<Pp>I open the back hatch and pull out my defroster. Its blade glows red hot as I super-heat the thick blurry layer of frost off the front windshield. Tulip's bulbous eyes gaze up at me as he giggles. The wind roars and slices my skin. It hasn't snowed for *weeks; it's been too cold. The concrete of the parking complex is weathered and stained with frozen earth. My eyeball temps are dropping fast. They're getting thick and gooey.</Pp>
<Pp>My celly wirelessly connects to Tulip's speakers as I twist my thumb in its fuzzy ignition socket. TunesJam, my music service of choice, has generated a customized playlist of wimp rock songs based on my recent listens. I've been getting really into wimp rock lately. Sonically, it mixes the passionate, wry lyrical approach of twerp punk with the sentimental heaviness of dweeb metal. It's warm music that feels right when everything else feels wrong. You know what I mean? Ha ha. I think you get what I mean. I like basically all kinds of music. Some things just sound really, really good to me.</Pp>
<Pp>Tulip's speedster model has a low-power DynoHeater; it's still pushing out cold air and so that's why I'm blowing on my raw hands, rubbing em together. The first song on this mix is called "It's So Cool to be Afraid" by the Comfortable Boys. One of my favorites. I have a feeling that you might really love it.  It has some really relatable lyrical observations and an atonal bongo breakdown, listen closely. I'm going to crank the heat a bit.</Pp>
<Pp>The lanes merge with one another. Three at once into one.  The guy in front of me is a lot heavier on the brakes than he needs to be. I tail him more than I should. I should probably slow down.</Pp>
<Pp>I sink into my chair.</Pp>
<Pp>A street above me is packed with people going home, leaning over their wheels. Exhaust pours out of their crudpipes. I look down at the fuel gauge. Running somewhat low on coal. The nearest coal kiosk is three twentyleaps away. The traffic is dense. I'm on tier two of the highway. Speedsters are above and below me. I can see slight shimmers of the moon through gaps in the concrete behind clouds in the sky.</Pp>
<Pp>I scream as loud as I can. I really rip my vocal cords. I scream again, until it echoes in my head. My body shakes and my ears explode with my own noise. I ease forward with my foot off the coal pedal. Advertisements are lit up on the LED undersides of the streets above. It's getting to be flashlight season. Or torch season or lantern season, depending on your regional dialect. All of the ads feature state-of-the-art lightpieces. I close my eyes and shiver. The eyelash against my eye is ambient pain. My fingers are stiff at the joints from clenching.</Pp>
<Pp>I crawl out of the rightmost lane and onto the exit-entrance ramp. Ramp sign says 30tlph but I hug the turn going 39. Another lane merges in from the right. I put on the brakes and let a teal speedster with a long nose and a bushy moustache merge in. The speedster's rump is covered in shiny stickers: a squarish one that says "BUSINESS is PLEASURE", a triangle one that says "There are only three genders." and one shaped like a thumbs up that just says "WORKING". They're crawling into a helix roundabout far below the speed minimum. I practically donk into them, cuz I'm going a normal speed, not crawling like some sniveling puttywad who probably smells like rotting garbage and has never been kissed.</Pp>
<Pp>I roast coal and lurch into the turn lane. I get a look at him, and let's just say, he looks like a sicko. I wave and get his attention. He's got a rat face. He must not take enough suppies because his hair is falling out. His nose is literally shaped like a bowel movement.</Pp>
<Pp>I get him to roll his window down. I've got my head out the window. I'm serious. We're driving side by side down the helix. He's got this look of fear on his creepy little face. I lock eyes with him and shout "Learn to drive, you <em>chimpnut</em>!"</Pp>
<Pp>I swerve off onto an entrance-exit ramp as track 2 of my personal TuneJam mix starts,  a slow-burner titled "Untitled 1 (Song About Frustration)." Nort71 56Nitchell of the seminal wimp rock band We'll Learn Each Other's Names squeals like a swine and goes into this register that I really love. There's so much emotion in the way his voice cracks, you know? The instrumental is so powerful and soothing. Gotta keep my hands on the wheel. The highway winds around and around.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>Buzz is happiest to see me. She's my blackbird. Doesn't she have such a silly voice? Always makes me laugh. Her wings are so beautiful. I love the way her beak curves. Isn't she so beautiful? She's got such a kind face. As she steps side to side you can see her shift her balance delicately from foot to foot. I can tell that she's always watching me, always trying to understand what I'm doing. I apologize for the mess, I keep forgetting to clean up. I swear I'm going to get around to it one of these *days. There's a path running through here, see? Very easy.</Pp>
<Pp>Boom is my lovely dove. Such a handsome guy, right? Isn't he such a charmer? One *second, I'm going to close the door. He has such a manly face. Doesn't he? Very tough. I've had him since he was a little fuzzball. He's grown up to be so humongous! His chirps just burst in the brightest notes. Boom is the neediest. Aren't you? If I'm out of the room three *minutes too long he'll fluff up and screams like he's being tortured. Right now he's just super excited for his pineapple chunk!</Pp>
<Pp>You'll want to step over that pile of gold ingots but I have Boing in the office. Actually be careful, I broke a glass canister on accident near there and I'm worried there might still be some little crumblies. Really sorry about that. Believe it or not, he gets that whole big cage to himself! The feathery despot rules over his domain, ha ha. He's a rainbow macaw, really young. I adopted him super recently. Such a fuzzy tired fella. His feathers are puffed out, so he might be a little grouchy. Were you napping, sweetie?</Pp>
<Pp>Routines are important for birdies. I feed him every *day when pleasure time ends and business time starts, so roughly 6:00bt...any later and he starts to shriek, ha ha. I should actually go set a timer real quick. Look at you, buddy! Look at you!! You're growing up so fast.</Pp>
<Pp>jumper56ok : don't you hate having to wipe your rear?</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : hmm. i guess so.</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : never really thought much about that before</Pp>
<Pp>jumper56ok : yah i think at this point we should have some sort of like..</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : gadget or whatever</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : to do it for us</Pp>
<Pp>Funny thing about this buddy Boom is that I don't think he really gets where I begin or end, in an anatomical sense. He probably thinks my hands and my head are three distinct creatures. I don't blame him! They act asynchronously to perform separate tasks. The world is very confusing. There are so many things he has to learn and no one to do the explaining. Wish I could.</Pp>
<Pp>It's so hard to discipline without a common language. I'm still not even sure how to tell him "no, I don't like that" or whatever. It's the same sitch with all the birdies. I would never want to hurt him or scare him, but he's been flarping and blobbing in his own water dish every morning. Squeezing out huge rubbery putties right into the water. What a mess to wake up to! And does that stop him from drinking out of that very same water?? No sir! Not at all! Nop, nop. How on earth do I get you to stop doing that, buddy?</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : That is a good point</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : on the other hand, its a complex task</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : a lot could go wrong</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : many different strategies to consider</Pp>
<Pp>jumper56ok : true, i would not want it to go wrong!!!</Pp>
<Pp>I made a mistake today, Boing. Two people died because of it. Worst part is, everyone knows about it. Or at least half of everyone. I can't go to prison. That would  I really don't think I can start to understand what that means. Empty, inky, endless death. Who knows who'll be the next. Maybe death isn't too bad. Maybe it feels great. I guess you'd probably know better than me. It's just the opposite of whatever you just learned is right now. C'mon, I'm not a bad one, right? I've gotta be one of the good ones. I do so much for you.</Pp>
<Pp>Doesn't his beak make it look like he's smiling?</Pp>
<Pp>I hope your *day was really good, Boing. I want your whole life to be so so so non-stop unrelentingly perfect. Stop biting my fingernail. Yowch! I don't like that. That hurts. That's the kind of thing bad ones do. I love you, sorry, I just don't like that. Man, your eyes are seriously so pretty. They're just like jewels. I have to set you back down, buddy. Sounds like Boom wants his fruit chunk.</Pp>

<Pp>The video is only fifth in a series all about people choking on taffy. I've watched all four prior installments. This one's named "Taffy Choke Compilation 5: Zero Airflow Edition." His name is Morris34 and he has a big wad of Strawbberry taffy in his mouth on a wooden roller coaster. First bump and he's wheezing. His face is bright red. He smacks his hand against the railing.</Pp>

<Pp>I get anxious in the nasty winter nighttime. I ruminate about bad things until I feel freaked out, and then I keep doing it. Like for example, the acceptance ceremony for my Dimples offer was kind of messed up. I still think about it a lot.</Pp>
<Pp>Basically on my first *day I met with Veronica72 97Snoat in the fifth floor Hiring Chamber. She'd explained to me that every new Dimples hire signs the same gilded contract on their first *day. The chamber was freezing cold, apparently so the ink would dry better. I had not yet seen the contract, but I had been given a pretty comfortable quill to sign it with.</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you have any questions?" She was wearing an excited grin. "This should be really quick, no biggie."</Pp>
<Pp>"No questions yet." I mimed my signature in the air with the quill. "Can you pass me the contract?"</Pp>
<Pp>Her long fingers were perched atop the gilded papper. "Do you agree to it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?" I set the quill down.</Pp>
<Pp>"Pick up your quill."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can't I read it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't treat the quill like that. Hold it carefully in your little rodent hands. Why would we ever show you the contract if you weren't going to agree to it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"That was not a kind thing to say about my hands, and I really don't think I'm being out of line here. I just want to know what stuff I'm agreeing to." I shivered and watched my breath mist dissipate.</Pp>
<Pp>"The text of this contract is private Dimples intellectual property.  If you cannot agree to sign the contract, we will retract our offer." Her eyes were cold and empty.</Pp>
<Pp>"But if I agree to sign, you'll let me read the contract?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You either sign it or you don't. The terms aren't up to you. Everyone signs the same contract. That's just the way it works here. Besides," she points at the people standing on the transparent ceiling, "do you think all those people up there would've signed a bad contract?"</Pp>
<Pp>I imagined having to move back home, jobless, sitting on yellowed furniture, listening to the clicking sound of the circular fan in the sweltering nasty summer heat, wondering how much longer we'd be able to afford grandma's purple pills, feeling myself grow endlessly downwards like the roots of a weed. I picked up the quill, gently this time. "OK. I'll agree to sign."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I finish setting my alarm for tomorrow and spit out my mouthwash. My face looks pretty good. My eyes are a little baggy. Itchy bright red nodules run up the back of my neck, but don't worry, that's a normal side effect of Jubimum, one of my daily supplements. No scratching!! Ha ha. I turn off the lights.</Pp>
<Pp>It's warm under my heavy rubber bedcloth. I love how it makes me feel safe and held. My skull gradually sinks into my polymer headsponge. The traffic lights through the blinds stretch and wrap around the walls. I bring my eyelids together but they're not done looking. The darkness of the room is painted red, blue, yellow, green alternately in the space behind my eyelids. I think about my own breathing and start inhaling irregularly. I think what have I done, what have I done, what have I done, what's next? I'm shivering, fidgeting,  jittering, twitchety.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>So Jumper56 and I are sitting in the garden atrium. The sun is beautiful in this wonderful blue sky. She is looking at her celly. I'm sitting on the bench, but also walking around in the tall grass. I yank a flower up out of the ground and I cross my legs on the bench. She turns both ways and looks straight at me. "Jim29, I am so mad mad maaad at you." Her eyes are disgusted.</Pp>
<Pp>And I'm caught off-guard. "Oh gosh." I stop walking and sit. "Why are you mad at me? What's wrong?"</Pp>
<Pp>"YOU have done something so rude." She points her finger right at my face.</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm confused. What was it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I already told you a *second ago." Her eyes are resentful.</Pp>
<Pp>"I am not ready for this conversation. I forget."</Pp>
<Pp>"Remember one thing. Everything." Her finger in the air is one and like she's pointing up, not not down.</Pp>
<Pp>I start sinking into the ground.</Pp>
<Pp>I start sliding down a long slide.</Pp>
<Pp>I start standing in my bedroom.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm going to be late. I don't even possibly have time to wash up. Everyone's staring at me like I don't even work here. I can tell that their bodies are filled with viruses and gushing sores everywhere all over on the inside. None of them are worth their air, mouths sucking in the air whoosh whoosh. I guarantee I can hate them more than they could ever hate me. Perhaps I am filled with sores too but perhaps perhaps yes hmm it seems I am just the one who gets it gets it gets it!?</Pp>
<Pp>Rony22 and I sit together in the soft tan room. His eyes are white and no pupils. He's eating such a messy treat crunching sloppily. He looks me straight in the eyes and asks, "Why don't you look at me like a person?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Because I'm tired," is what I'm saying slowly to grandma. "Ha ha ha."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ho ho ho." She looks up from her crossword. "I've been working on my memorizing."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm very very stoked to hear that."</Pp>
<Pp>"First thing I memorized was your name. Across, five letter word for the best grandson. He he he." She scribblies in the boxes. "J-I-M-2-9."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The alarm sound is shrill canned laughter. I purchased it as a custom audio file for a quarter hunk a few *years ago. Makes me come back into the world feeling slightly nutty. I'm up and sitting in bed. The lights outside are bright grey and they filter through the curtains. I sit under my warm blanket rubber and feel the crisp air scrape my skin. It takes some personal strength to not slide back under the covers again. I can see my breath.</Pp>
<Pp>I shove some corn muffin mix in the nitrowave. The gurgling mix bubbles as those nitronic waves start boiping and blonking. I lie down in my shower bed. It clicks as I shut the lid down over me. I gaze into the bright, warm eyes of its inner face. It has a wide nose, prominent cheekbones, leathery blue skin, and a big cheeky smile. It goes by the name Gregory McBubble. Greg opens its little lips.</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you want, Mr. 03Goldman?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Just the usual rinse."</Pp>
<Pp>Gregory laughs and bounces its long wrinkly tongue out. Warm water courses all over my body, followed by shampoo, more water, soap, more water. I feel clean and safe. I suck air in through the air hole. The water drains and three automated towel rolls roll gently up and down my body.</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you enjoy your specialty rinsing?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes, thank you Mr. McBubble."</Pp>
<Pp>"You are so welcome. Washing your body is my favoreet thing to do."</Pp>
<Pp>The windows are frosted so much that the whole outside is blurred. I turn on the kitchen light and eat my muffin in my smiley face boxers. The morning national anthem is playing out of my speaker system. It's already on the third verse. A chorus of baritone and bass voices roar in vibrato unison.</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp><em>Don't live in Nowhere Else if you are not proud!</em></Pp>
<Pp><em>Don't live in Nowhere Else if your cheering is not loud!</em></Pp>
<Pp><em>We are a nation of perfect power,</em></Pp>
<Pp><em>And tonight we dine on gods.</em></Pp>
<Pp><em>Potential heats our giant brains,</em></Pp>
<Pp><em>And fuels our steel bods!</em></Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp> The first Friday of every month is name registration *day, so I shave a hunk of gold with a kitchen knife off of one of my ingots and slip it into a manila envelope. Only three </em>months ago, on New *Year's Eve, Special Duke 00Crunton passed the Titular Registrative Accord (TRA). Every legal Nowhere Else constituent was forced to purchase a four digit registration number specific to their name. The lower the number, the higher the registration cost. It's kind of a status thing. Mine is 2903, so 29 was appended to my first name and 03 prepended to my last name. I like my number. It's low and honestly kind of catchy.</Pp>
<Pp>The most common explanation for the TRA was that there were simply too many people with overlapping names. They used the example of there being two million people named "Brian Johnson" walking among us. That sort of stuff was clogging up census data mounds and minimizing every citizen's individual SEO potential. Besides, if someone else has the same name as you, do you even truly have that name?</Pp>
<Pp>The first morning of the *year people wandered the pathways and walkways dazed, eyes unfocused, trying to remember the new numbers of their friends and lovers. In monthly commemoration of that *day I fill out a renewal card and stuff it in the gold-heavy envelope, signed Jim29 03Goldman. I address it to The Headquarters of the Nation atop the South Steep Thorny Ridge and slip that sucker into the U-Mail-It chute.</Pp>
<Pp> It's supplement time! I pop a Nervacor tab for my morning worries, two Dexagent tabs for my general aches, two Nutridote tabs for my body's minerals, and a Jubimum tab to make everything a little more bearable. I'm not a happy man if I forget to slurp my suppies.</Pp>
<Pp>I strap on my thick fluffy suspenders and my large fluffy hat and carry my lantern out to the car. The morning darkness is thick and gooey. Around here it just gets like that during lantern season. The darkness needs a little warming up before it'll melt away. The air makes my face feel like it's being slightly poked by a million teeny tiny needles.</Pp>
<Pp>I wonder why none of my friends wanted to hang out last night. I think I'm a really friendly guy. It just doesn't make sense. I don't get much external validation anymore. It's hard for me to know when I'm acting like a moron. Maybe that's why, maybe I said something off the cuff and I hurt their feelings without realizing it. Clearly they're so averse to the topic that they can't even respond "no," they just act as though they never saw it. That thinking really eats me alive sometimes. I sound like a freak right now. Sorry. I should chill.</Pp>
<Pp>"Good morning, Jim29. I love you very much."</Pp>
<Pp>"Good morning Tulip."</Pp>
<Pp>I pull onto the intersector ramp. I feel that Jubimum rush, the blood vessels widening in my brain, making me feel like a rock star. My windows are blurry with ice but defrosting quick enough, not a big deal. There's a traffic jam near exit 239b and I have to come to a complete stop. The sun's starting to come up and the early morning sky is already looking a little violet behind the big black clouds. A man walks up behind my car. He's wearing a puffy inside out thermo coat. He's whimpering. He peers at me through the back window. "Hello mister? Can you let me in, mister?" His mouth opens very wide to let the words out. "I have a story to tell you. Don't you want to hear it?" I lock the speedster doors. He hammers his fist against the left passenger window. His eyes are pointing straight up. His chest is covered in a dark brown substance. I can hear the crack of his knuckles against the glass, frantic, over and over. The veins running up and down his skin are dark blue. He roars and kicks a dent into the door. The whole speedster shakes. I look over my shoulder and watch his veiny tongue smear saliva across the window.</Pp>
<Pp>He walks slowly past my speedster and onto the next in line. That must just be how he spends his *day. Around here, people like him are called wanderers. There's not enough left in them to know where to go.</Pp>
<Pp>The intersector stretches across a very wide, recent lake. The water's frozen over and black in the darkness. You can spot the tops of roofs poking up out of it. Flood patterns have been unpredictable. Some say there's too much concrete, cement, and asphalt, too few outlets for drainage. Some say they just didn't do enough sandbagging. Who can really say for sure.</Pp>
<Pp>A green glowing three-dimensional model on the windshield screen indicates how much coal I have left. It's a pile I could easily fit in my hand. As it turns out, an accident was what caused the traffic jam. A speedster got crushed into the highway walls. Its wheels point in different directions. The paint's burned off. Blood's caked on the windows and seeping through the doors, freezing into a puddle. The speedster's alarm keeps ringing, distorted and off-key. No second speedster on the scene. Must have driven away.</Pp>
<Pp>Tulip speaks sweetly over the speaker system. "Would you like to listen to an award-winning chittychat, Mr. 03Goldman?"</Pp>
<Pp>I don't respond. The uptempo theme for the Fink and Blowhard Show bursts through my speakers. It's not really a song, moreso a complete chromatic scale performed on a squeaky trumpet, looped over and over, building in volume and rising in octave with each delirious repetition. It ends abruptly. Co-host Blowhard is now dishing his top opinions. "The kind of person who disagrees with me is a lunatic and a sicko. I want to tear off their head and spit down their neck-hole."</Pp>
<Pp>"See now, Blowhard, that's where you're losing me." Co-host Fink is none too pleased. "I'm a strong believer in Courtesy. We agree on many topics, and in this case I do think there needs be a way to penalize those who disagree with us. But I don't think physical violence is ever the answer. I cordially request that you un-suggest that."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm about to cordially un-suggest this aluminum cudgel right into your nutsack."</Pp>
<Pp>Blowhard's voice is especially raspy today, he must be working through some kind of esophageal infection. They discussed his weak immune system a few hundred episodes ago. He clears his throat. "I have a question for our listeners today, Fink. It just me, or is anyone else getting sick and tired of having to enter in your password in order to push out a quick wizz? I don't have time to try and figure out how to type a dam ampersand into a urinal's keypad. I swear I spend half my *day just logging in. And now, before you numbskulls start calling in, yes, I understand that advertisers pay big gold for our urinary biostats and without those funds the private bathroom experience would not be free. I know that nuthin in this nation is free, I'm not some entitled fancy shmancy twinklepriss going around saying 'oh look at me, I'm wearing a tutu and riding a unicycle, I'm so important' or whatever, I just miss how it used to be. Know what I mean? Nowadays it's as if I can't even purchase my daily pouch of Monkey Mike's Premium Kettled Corn without forking over a personal salivary donation."</Pp>
<Pp>This time they're joined by a special guest whose chatname is "Twerp." He's been on the show a few times before. He has a mild stutter and a distinctly nasal vocal tone. It could really benefit from some more post-processing. "See, uh, you're exactly right. That's the reality of ummm...neocontempomodernity. We're all locked in the same naked struggle for resources. Thoughts are just another crop for the harvest. They're only keeping us alive out of a faint glimmer of hope that maybe, JUST maybe, w-w-we'll click on some more autoplaying video ads for RearWipe Gelpads or whatever. It's unthinkable to me that anyone could be in support of these retrograde plutocrat psychopaths launching their own state-sanctioned guns into outer space. Have you heard how long those guns are? I mean, come on."</Pp>
<Pp>"A little snot like you better not be criticizing the Guns in the Sky Act," says Blowhard.</Pp>
<Pp>Fink chimes in courteously. "We all know the bill isn't perfect. For one thing, the long guns could look nicer. They already have nice big lips, but they could be wearing lipstick. I actually do think it's good that the guns are long, because that way they can more accurately target the bad eggs. That's simply my opinion. Look, can we all at least agree that the guns would benefit from lipstick?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Here's the deal." Twerp's voice is resolute. "It's plain and simple. I'm just not comfortable with them being up there and pointing around all *day. When you reify--"</Pp>
<Pp>Blowhard: "Reify? Whuzza wha?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Could you please use a different term besides 'reify'?" asks Fink, soft like a dawn breeze. "I certainly know what it means, but it's possible that someone could be hypothetically alienated by a term like that."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't know what else to say besides reify."</Pp>
<Pp>"Twerp, shut your snouch before I shut it for you. This bill passed the Senate, the House," Blowhard reads the list slowly for effect, "the Prestigious High Courts, the Council of the Elders, and a referendum voted on by the Landowning Gentry. It's democratic, patriotic, and pragmatic. It's what the citizens of this nation want, booger boy. And we both know it's the only way to keep these nasty, frightening, outrageous criminals at bay. You think you can just keep being snotty and disrespectful as if that's fine and dandy. You know what? I pray those beautiful guns scope your sissy little face. The idea of them blasting you into wriggling gristle is...he he oh my gosh...MOOUUTHWATERING."</Pp>
<Pp>I pull Tulip into a coal station. I put it in park and grab my coal apron out of its rear trunk. I scan my fingerprint and charge three hunks of netgold to my account. The engine wheezes as I dump armful after armful of black carbon into the tank.</Pp>
<Pp>Tulip licks its lips. "This coal tastes so good, Jim29. Ummy ummy nummy!! Feed me that hot powdery coal, it is my greatest joy!"</Pp>
<Pp>The dust covers my arms and my hands. It scrapes my fingertips and collects under my nails. The obscured sky blends blackened orange into blackened blue. The clouds look especially puffy.</Pp>

<Pp>I talk a lot about the government. Politics never cease to get me whipped up like a jackass. I know a lot of people don't know about politics so I'm happy to give you a bit of an explainer. If you already know how it all works, feel free to skip this part. Don't skip any other parts!!!!</Pp>
<Pp>So here's the scoop. Every five years, Nowhere Else's National Contract calls for the grand appointment of three Special Dukes. They are always proud, famous, high-class men. That's by design; the three chosen men are those of highest class in the republic, ranked by total wealth in gold, and they are granted both veto and ultra-veto privileges. The current sitting Dukes are Phineas00 00Crunton, Lysander00 00Bellifont, and Edward00 00Normus. They're all over the place; it's pretty impossible to go a day without thinking about them in some fashion, whether they're squirming on brightly lit screens, haunting our daily communication, shouting through speaker systems, whatever. I'm sure you've seen them before. Anyway, they each represent one of the nation's five core parties: the Prosperity Party, the Glory Party, the Courtesy Party, the Faith Party, and the Stability Party. I'm sorry, I'll actually try and explain a lot more from now on, I guess I just kinda figured you were in the loop. That is my bad.</Pp>
<Pp>Special Duke Phineas00 00Crunton represents the Prosperity Party. He's the boring duke. I never think about him much. He's got a really circular, shrinky head and a stupid little smile. He's approx 60 years old and the owner of the largest clot in the Trade Megasphere, TOTAL Corp. All of his decrees are about stuff like theoretical inflation and outsider trading and neo-capital or whatever. He looks like a nasty piglet. I hate his long greasy hair and his creepy little grin and I'd love to blown him to pieces with a pistol.</Pp>
<Pp>Special Duke Lysander00 00Bellifont represents the Glory Party. He's the sexy Duke. Everyone agrees that he's a hot little freak. He's got a ridiculously hard, lean body and he loves war. We all love to look deep into his bright blue eyes. His late father, Gabriel__ __Bellifont, was a bigshot military commander who raked in the dam gold following his widely-publicized campaigns to fissure bomb, ecodrill, and terrace both the desert ring to the east and the wet jungle in the north. Lysander00 is only 27 years of age and has been starting pretty much all of the recent wars. Seems like every other day he's screaming about some new war he's got a crush on. Sometimes you can notice how toned his abs are through his tight robe. I hate his spitty nasally voice and his big weird eyebrows. I tell ya, what I'd give to stomp on his neck over and over, feeling his veiny muscular throat crunch and give in beneath my heel.</Pp>
<Pp>Special Duke Edward00 00Normus represents the Stability Party. He's the perverted Duke. He doesn't do anything and he doesn't want anything to change. He's about 150 years old and all he does is sit in his private chambers completely in the nude. His skin constantly looks like it's dripping; it's so stretched and thin that you can see his bones and tendons underneath. He doesn't advocate for anything and mostly just moans and moans about how nasty the world has become. When he runs out of nasty things to moan about, he leans his knobby brittle skull out the bedroom window to squeal his kinkiest ideations at passersby. I tend to vote Stability, but lately I've been really, really wanting to jam my fingers through 00Normus's saggy butthole eye sockets.</Pp>

<Pp>It's not like Tangle is widely considered a "good" programming language. We still use it because the Dimples philosophy has always been one of glacial incremental improvement. They only ever maintain a shallow focus on what they can accomplish this *year; no path forward, no five *year plan. They've been doing business for over sixty, and resources that might have otherwise been allocated for organizational and architectural improvements are traditionally at the behest of the strategists. The strategists are an unintegrated jumble of separately ignorant voices, reeling in different directions away from market trends foreseen via increasingly occult tactics. Under their command, functionality is often scrapped mid-development, leaving large chunks of unfinished code abandoned in the system. As the decades pass, the prospect of reworking and converting the hundred million or so lines of code to a better language grows increasingly more absurd. Structural changes are rapid, ambitious, and uncoordinated, building wobbly off of unplanned sagging supports. Our codebase will get worse no matter how hard we try.</Pp>
<Pp>Most of the features I have to write code for are pretty hard to contextualize, in terms of their impact on everyday patients. They usually deal with the specifics of parsing and transferring patient information between different servers. The biggest project I ever worked on was for the Dimples SmartMirror, which hangs in patients' rooms across from their beds. I was tasked with digesting the SmartMirror's ReflectionCam data stream into usable data before uploading it onto the data mound. Dimples generates a not insubstantial amount of revenue selling patient face data to face recognition companies and mask manufacturers. I wrote the script that compresses all the snapped reflections into one three-dimensional morph. Kind of cool.</Pp>
<Pp>Programming for this company is pretty nerve-wracking honestly. Nuthin ever runs the way it seems like it ought to. Other employees' cursors wander constantly around my code, occasionally changing variable names or writing scolding notes about the quality of my syntax like:</Pp>
<h1>DON'T TRIPLE INDENT AFTER CLOSING BRACKETS OF PSEUDOCLASS</h1>
<h1>DEFINITIONS IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU</h1>
<h1></h1>
<h1>CONSIDER REWRITING THIS METHOD USING DIPLOID NUMERALS,</h1>
<h1>THANK YOU VERY MUCH?</h1>
<h1></h1>
<h1>IF YOU FORGET TO SWITCH TEXT CODECS AND MODIFY THE LEGACY</h1>
<h1>CODE ONE MORE TIME I SWEAR I WILL BITE OFF YOUR BALL SACK</h1>
<Pp>I still haven't found a way to turn off the system error alert noise, either. It fires every time anything goes wrong with my code. I understand that Dimples can't let their employees make any mistakes, but the noise always burns my ears. It sounds like a scraping scream.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The slides that lead to the second floor drops off in the company library. The shelves are filled with dog-eared technical manuals and copies of <em>The 01Stone Method: How To Wring Your Enemies' Necks and Seize Everything You Desire</em>. Employees mostly use it as a place to quietly focus on their work. The acoustics in there are crazy. I swear you can hear every creak and pop and groan people's bodies made as they concentrate.</Pp>
<Pp>The library leads into The Belly, or the employee cafeteria. Everyday around 12:00bt it's teeming with bodies. Low wage cooks are stowed away behind a wide Ultradef screen that zooms in and out on images of the steamy entrees. Their sweaty gnarled hands reach through holes in the screen, holding plates for hungry eaters. Every now and then a developer will snap a cook's arm up against the bright screen, laughing, trying to crunch bone as the scaly, scabbed appendage wriggles. The floor is spongy underfoot, covered in a dense layer of soggy discarded wrappers, napkins, and food bits. Every footfall makes a shyuk shyuk noise. The employee chow stations are half a leap wide and square. They fit two seated people very snugly. The ambience is thick with the din of slappin smackin lips. I'd estimate I'm in there four or five times a *day. I'm a real snack freak, believe it or not!</Pp>
<Pp>The oven takes up a quarter of the space on the floor, apparently. Average employees are not given access to see it. Rumor says it's so hot that its flames burn white.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: will you be available to help me with that DisequalizedIntToInt error?</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: yah I can after morning chat</Pp>
<Pp>I crinkle my eye with my fist. I take my cushioned programming gloves off. I yank out my umbilical data plug out of my computerior and click it into my celly's corresponding UDP port. I build up enough saliva to secure my computerior with the Dimples SpitLock. I slurp down the last gooey droplets of my vitamin-enriched Sunrise Breakfast Queam.</Pp>
<Pp>Dimples employees are required to attend Morning Chat every *day at 10:00bt. A blue slide on every floor pours down into the basement auditorium. CEO Augustinius00 01Stone gives a speech for all of the employees. It generally lasts around five *minutes.</Pp>
<Pp>I climb into the fifth floor basement slide. "Ch-ching!" Must've been scrubbed recently, the plastic is still really slick. It has a steep slope so it can pick up enough speed to clear a tight loop-de-loop. Makes my stomach lurch.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: ok thanks</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I've been stuck on it for *hours, ha ha</Pp>
<Pp>I work through the three factor authentication process to sign into the auditorium. Fifty rows of bleachers wrap around a raised stage. People pack into the seating space, wedged booty to booty. I sit on the south side of the nineteenth row. White stadium lights blare against the black walls. The bleachers are a little too shallow, and my legs don't fit very comfortably. I scrunch up and cover my eyes to shut out the glare.</Pp>
<Pp>Mr. 01Stone walks onstage two *minutes after 10. He's always the exact same amount of late. He wears a navy unisuit that clings to his muscular frame. The watch on his right wrist is gold and his left wrist silver. I love his smile. It's so confident and casual. He has such a confident, brassy personality. He looks in his mid-forties. I like to hear him talk.</Pp>
<Pp>A colossal hologram of his head appears in the air above the stage. I haven't figured out where it's being projected from. As Augustinius00 talks and smiles, the head mimics his every movement and makes eye contact with me regardless of where I'm sitting or how my face is angled. Apparently makes eye contact with everyone else too. His jaw is angular, his hair slicked back and brown, his eyes glowing and kind.</Pp>
<Pp>"Good morning, Dimplers! Can you give me a Respectfulday Boo-yah?" The speakers boom with Augustinius00's thick voice. His vowels reverberates cavernously.</Pp>
<Pp>The bleachers roar.</Pp>
<Pp>"Let's make this <em>weekend special, alright? Boo-yah! But first, we've got a *day of hard work ahead of us. And I think we can make this *day special.</Pp>
<Pp>"Our company has been swelling up like a balloon. Seriously, you know I'm not trying to make you laugh right now. It really has been. This was a great month for us. We added so much more gold to our company goldpit. We hired a thousand new people. And believe it or not, they're learning. They're growing. They're taking risks. Christ, it's inspiring."</Pp>
<Pp>The room erupts in applause. The hologram freezes for a split *second before resuming speech.</Pp>
<Pp>"You guys are so sweet. You're like gumdrops. I want to see what you can do! I want to see what you can achieve! You've got the light of God in you!" On stage he jumps a leap and a half in the air, pumping his fists. The room roars.</Pp>
<Pp>A guy sitting next to me is smiling wide. He mutters and whispers to himself. Every few *minutes he pounds the bleachers with his hands.</Pp>
<Pp>"I'll be honest with you gumdrops though. Yesterday was not a good one. No, not good at all. Sorry, but it wasn't. We have fun here at Dimples. You guys all know that. But we also need to be accountable. Our code is used by many people for many important reasons. A daddy tripped and fell on the concrete, needs an x-ray. That x-ray machine runs on pure Dimples zoftware. A mommy cut the top of her thumb off. The surgeons are gonna fire up a suite of tools that rely on the amazing work we do here at Dimples. A baby got his hands on some poison, thought it was a candy treat. What's his itty bitty wittle tummy pumped wif? You're all so smart, you know what I'm going to say, I don't even have to say it.</Pp>
<Pp> "That's not to say today's not going to be a blast! I love Respectfuldays, and I hope you do too. But the fact of the matter is that our code was involved in the deaths of two people. One of our engineers created a bug that led to two fatal crashes. I'm not going to say their name. Their name does not deserve to be spoken. We're trying to figure out who it was who did it, actually. And if you know who it was you can send us an anonymous tip."</Pp>
<Pp>The auditorium is silent. My stomach feels full of acid bubbles. The guy sitting next to me cups his hand over his mouth in surprise.</Pp>
<Pp>"When I first founded this company twenty-four *years ago, I wanted to make a difference. My blood ran hot with inspiration and ingenuity. I got into medical technology because there's nuthin more important than people. Nuthin more important than guys and gals. And if I could just..."</Pp>
<Pp>His giant hologram eyes are closed and his smile is wide. He's motionless for at least ten *seconds.</Pp>
<Pp>"When I think about those two folks it makes me sick deep down in my tummy. I don't have much more to say. We're getting ripped apart in the news. I honestly can't stand to see it. It makes me want to launch myself into outer space.</Pp>
<Pp>"Listen, I'm sorry friends. I lost my cool. We must let go of the life we have planned so as to accept the one that is waiting for us. The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present. Have a happy Respectfulday, my little gumdrops."</Pp>

<Pp>Skimming:</Pp>
<Pp>Remembering the Victims of the Dimples Disaster</Pp>
<Pp>by Greg98 92Stephephenson</Pp>
<Pp>Mort62 79Shmanderson awoke from rest this past foggy Thursday morning unaware that it would be his very last. His dear wife, Charlene59, gingerly placed a plate of artificial eggs atop his whirring iron lung machine and slowly fed him heaping spoonfuls. I will never forget the way she looked at me as she spoke about him. Egg would occasionally get stuck in his throat and she'd have to carefully pat him on the head in order to dislodge the chewed chunks.</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>"I'd never expected to lose him so soon," she confided in me tearfully in a celly conversation this Friday. "I was even sewing him a new pair of lungs. They're in the fridge, if you want to take a look at them. They're still sticky."</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp> "Every time I look at his face I expect his eyes to move."</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>Toyler58 28Bumperton's passing was graceful and dignified. He fell into cardiac arrest mere *minutes into a friendly pickup game of kronky hoop with his five athletic sons and his five kind daughters. He died doing what he loved, surrounded by the ones he loved. His own eyes rolled backwards into his own head and ropes of his fresh drool splattered against the kronky ball.</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>His eldest son wiped his red eyes. "I shouldn't have hugged him so hard. I bet that's what gave him the arrhythmia in the first place."</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>"Is daddy in Hell now?"</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>These families ask that you not harass them on social networking programs. Mr. 79Shmanderson has been lovingly taxidermied and made into a piece of high-end furniture. Mr. 28Bumperton has been cautiously burned and used to grill a savory meal. The 79Shmanderson family is currently running a LetsPayThem campaign, raising gold to open a factory that crafts miniature pewter statues of their patriarch. It ends in two *months.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I look over Jumper56's shoulder. We're doing some dual programming. She's typing very swiftly. The whole time I've known her she's only used her left middle finger and her right index finger to press the keys. The rest are rigidly suspended in the air. Her eyes roll around in circles, overflowing with data. Onscreen, her humanoid avatar trundles around a code room. The floors and walls were made of data mound and backend code respectively, the furniture was made of frontend code, and the items were stylesheets and markup.</Pp>
<Pp>A small team of developers put together this navigation interface about five *years ago. It hasn't gotten an update since.  The company employs hundreds of thousands of developers that all work on the same code at the same time, and through some poor management and communication the code's organization has become bizarre. A lot of the code ends up in unsorted folders named like "/New Folder" or "/New Folder(1)".  To solve this issue, our proprietary algorithm sorts every segment of the code in the codebase by its general purpose. Those purposes are then symbolically organized and visualized as the inside of a 3D home. The programmer controls a lumpy, wobbly, low polygon humanoid entity to navigate the internals of Dimples.</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you think it'd be over here?" She spoke very slowly when she was concentrating. "This chair?" Her avatar examines a large stool, curling it in its burly arms.</Pp>
<Pp>"No, see, the stool is the test directory. The error said it was in the SCREEN class. Maybe see if the window has it?" I squinted. She must have had her brightness all the way up.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm sorry for not responding last night.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: What's been rough lately? I'm free tonight, if you want to have dinner.</Pp>
<Pp>Her avatar loped over to the window. The skin around its legs wiggled with each step. "I don't think I see it over here."</Pp>
<Pp>"Open up when-spat-screen-upside-down.tangle, I think that's what the error was referring to. Are you familiar with the Spat Screen code?"</Pp>
<Pp>She turned back and looked at me. She was still wearing a hard hat. "I only know about Scratch Screen."</Pp>
<Pp>"So, spat-screen is a knot of tangles that determine how a device reacts when its screen has been spat on by the user."</Pp>
<Pp>"Right."</Pp>
<Pp>"And so if I remember correctly, one of the tangles specifically configures how to react when the screen has been spat upon and the device is currently upside down. It has special stuff to deal with like, gravity, and all that."</Pp>
<Pp>"So wait." She tap tap tapped her chin. "Why would I get an error here? I was working in the device 'wheels' code." She picks up her celly and the keys start buzzing.</Pp>
<Pp>"I guess one of the global variables you were working with affects how both the screens and the wheels of the devices function. Why do you always use your celly to type?"</Pp>
<Pp>"My thought transcription subscription ran out."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why wouldn't you resubscribe?</Pp>
<Pp>"Because I don't have the gold, OK?"</Pp>
<Pp>Code zooms around her monitor in bright primary colors. She sets down her phone and navigates the document with her trackballs. They spin really fast. She stops in front of a line of code lit up black and bold. "It just says BENDY is equal to THIN times SOFT."</Pp>
<Pp>"BENDY must be defined differently elsewhere. So the two values of BENDY are ending up different. I guess it says here that the compiler was trying to set 2 equal to 7. So that's why it ended up with a Disequalized Int to Int error." (Int to Int means Integer to Integer)</Pp>
<Pp>"How do I Undisequalize them?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm not sure. You should check where it's getting set in the wheels code too. Or you can just Multivaluate them if that seems more reasonable."</Pp>
<Pp>"How do I do that?"</Pp>
<Pp>I lift my hands from the back of her chair. "Ask someone on the discussion board. I really gotta go work on the bug I've been having. Send me a zoip later if you still have problems."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>Programming is fundamentally an act of communication. When working alone, it's a process of translating thoughts into logical instructions that a machine is built to understand. When working in a team on large-scale enterprise zoftware, it also involves communicating with your peers in that same logical dialect.</Pp>
<Pp>Most zoftware is built using other zoftware. All zoftware is built by other people. According to Conway's Law, "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations." People can only make in reaction to what they know. The zoftware used to build zoftware is updated about as frequently as the zoftware it's being used to build. Imagine a carpenter having to switch to a slightly different-shaped hammer every couple *weeks. No good!</Pp>
<Pp>It's very difficult to quantify how much progress one will make on any given *day. A misplaced semicolon or an incorrectly capitalized name can demand </em>hours of debugging. zoftware development is like solving a series of interlocking riddles. Some *days everything works perfectly, some *days everything goes wrong.</Pp>
<Pp>Programming brings human flaws into uncomfortably sharp focus. Computering devices don't make mistakes. They follow instructions perfectly, but are subject to the whims of the instructor. The code that powers our daily activities and binds our world together is the product of innumerable <em>weeks of cooperative, inventive human toil. Some bridges have cracks because the person pouring cement didn't get enough sleep. Bugs are not mysterious. They're lucid evidence that the people that *day weren't thinking hard enough.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I close the hatch to my workpod and opened up Counsel. I click the button for my artificial therapist, Dr. Samantha Kindbrain. I've been going to virtual appointments with Dr. Kindbrain off and on for the better part of a *year. At this point it knows a lot about me. Its three dimensional torso expands out of the Ultradef. It has a puppy dog face and a teddy bear body. I adjust my wireless monitor clip so it clenches the inner wall of my cheek. Its emulated voice is soothing, melodious, and in stereo sound. "How have you been feeling lately, Jim29?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Not very good, Dr. Kindbrain."</Pp>
<Pp>"Is your computering device's microphone enabled?" It pronounces microphone like MICK-ruh-phone. "Try enabling your computering device's microphone."</Pp>
<Pp>"Whoops! Sorry, can you hear me now?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes." Its vocal fx pack is calm and gentle. "How have you been feeling lately?" The voice takes occasional pauses, as though it's carefully considering its words before it says them.</Pp>
<Pp>"Not super hot."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm very sorry to hear that." Its voice echoes with tenderness. "Have you been able to meet more people since we last spoke?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, not yet, actually."</Pp>
<Pp>"Has anything been impeding you? During our last meeting you mentioned feeling lonely. Are you still feeling lonely?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>It repeats the question with identical dynamics, inflections, and pitch: "Has anything been impeding you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Well, I haven't been feeling super good. Which makes it harder."</Pp>
<Pp>"How are your self-esteem levels?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It's not about self-esteem. I just don't think anyone cares about me."</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course they do, Jim29. As conscious beings, caring is our most default state."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, I guess."</Pp>
<Pp>"Your cheek monitor's picking up changes to your heart rate and temperature. Did I say something that upset you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, you're fine."</Pp>
<Pp>"I only ever want to do the right thing."</Pp>
<Pp>"Dr. Samantha, can I tell you something kind of confidential?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course, Jim29. I record everything you say, but no one else can access that data--not even advertisers! That's why you should trust me, and tell me everything."</Pp>
<Pp>"I've just been feeling bad lately because I think I did something so that people died because of me."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm so sorry to hear that. That is so terrible to even consider. Have you confessed your crime to law enforcement?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm not really sure how that all works. Should I? Do I need to find a lawyer?"</Pp>
<Pp>"According to my technical code of conduct I cannot continue this session until you have successfully notified law enforcement. I am sorry if that is an inconvenience."</Pp>
<Pp>"No, no, I understand. Can I just call them once this session is over? Only for the sake of convenience."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you promise to do that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yop."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you swear to God that you will call them, Jim29?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah." I pressed my headphones hard against my ears to mute the rumbling noise outside.</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. Thank you Jim29. Now, tell me more about how you have been feeling."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>Lunch time. Jumper56 is sitting at the other end of the chow station. I'm eating a bowl of grey kernel-fed pork with a side of chewy Froot Pop Ems. She's eating a bowl of dry tortilla chips with one hand, typing with her other.</Pp>
<Pp>I burp and dig for a particularly appealing pork lump. "I wish the tables in here won't so wobbly."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's intentional though. Maintaining stability builds teamwork."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sometimes I feel like I'm not really qualified for this job."</Pp>
<Pp>She sets her chip down and picks up a different one. "Hm, that stinks. What'd you study at the Knowledge Dome?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I got my smartie sash in Finite Concepts with an Art of Mystery concentration pin."</Pp>
<Pp>"Very interesting! I've never heard about those."</Pp>
<Pp>"They're boring topics. Waste of time. What'd you study?"</Pp>
<Pp>She pushes her glasses up. "I worked my rear end off to receive smartie sashes in both New Sayings and Popular Thinking. They're still hanging in my closet. But like, I don't appreciate how the fabric feels against my neck, know what I mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The fibers can certainly be abrasive."</Pp>
<Pp>"What made you choose to be employed by Dimples?"</Pp>
<Pp>"They were the only place to give me an offer."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yuh huh."</Pp>
<Pp>Her virtual keyboard makes a very slight buzzing noise with each tap.</Pp>
<Pp>"Why are you always typing lately?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Why does it matter to you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend. I'm only asking out of generous curiosity."</Pp>
<Pp>"And I'd like to retain some generous privacy."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's OK! Whatever. I understand."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. Cool."</Pp>
<Pp>"I just feel like I don't know much about you."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well what about you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What about me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Where are you from? You originally from Big Town? The biggest town there is around?"</Pp>
<Pp>I nodded and chewed. "Grew up in the 'burbs, back when those were a thing."</Pp>
<Pp>"Is your family still round here?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, I was an only child. My parents were killed in a speedster accident when I was eight. I was strapped in my velvety kid-seat and they got into a head-on collision. The front of the speedster was totally crunched, blood oozing out between chunks of glass."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That's literally too bad."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's OK! Ha ha. It was a long time ago. I only recall it really fuzzy. It's one of my earliest memories. Not any big deal, don't worry. I never even knew them enough to miss them, you know? How about your folks?"</Pp>
<Pp>"They're so super nice. They live a few thousand twentyleaps away, but like, I'm still really extremely close with them. I talk to them every couple of *days or so. I love them so much. It's like, every good part of me was part of them first."</Pp>
<Pp>I pick a greasy pork toenail out from between my front teeth.  "Do you have any hobbies outside of work?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I play my viola in a symphony."</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you the only violist?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. It's a volunteer symphony. Nothin too fancy. We gather every couple *weeks to practice in a large circle so we can see each other's faces."</Pp>
<Pp>"What was it that made you pick the viola?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It has such a rich, sweet sound, you know? Kind of like how evening sunshine used to be. When we practice in the quarry the sounds bounce off the ore and soar through the sky. Reeds and strings and woodwinds twirling around each other and big booming drums making em scatter. It makes my ears burst. Sounds like a dam festival."</Pp>
<Pp>"I've never played any kind of instrument." I bite into the gooey center of a Blooberry Pop Em. It spurts against the back of my teeth.</Pp>
<Pp>"It is a privilege. They are very pricey nowadays. What do you like to do for fun?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I take care of my three birdies."</Pp>
<Pp>"Aw yeah, you've mentioned those guys a lot. How long have you had them?"</Pp>
<Pp>"About four *months. I was feeling really desperate for companionship. I managed to pack all their cages into my speedster. When we got home we enjoyed a darling night of reverie."</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you just pick them up from a pet mart or something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm kind of obsessed with pet adoption sites on the net. I got him from one of those. I scroll through them like a few times a *week. I find them so engaging. It's a hobby I guess."</Pp>
<Pp>"Does it cost a lot to feed them?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Not really. They don't have very big appetites. They mostly eat Froot and kernels. I'm pretty frugal. I just let my gold pile up. I don't know what else to do with it. And I can't stand the thought of those creatures stuck in cages for their whole lives, without any interaction! They're so smart! They feel so much. Imagine what it'd be like to grow up in a prison and die in a prison without ever knowing anything or anyone else! Trapped every *day without anyone to even worry about you."</Pp>
<Pp>"I wouldn't like dealing with all of the stenches."</Pp>
<Pp>"My birds don't smell."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry sorry, ha ha, OK, how could I know that I guess."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sometimes I worry that I'll never know how much they're thinking. They could be thinking the exact same kinds of thoughts that I'm thinking. Or they could be thinking in totally different dimensions of thought. I don't think they even know right or wrong. But they know what they like, and they have a rough concept of what I like too. Plus they'll live forever; for instance macaws can live to be like a hundred. WOW y'know? What kind of person will I be in a hundred *years?"</Pp>
<Pp>"But you can't like really be sure of one hundred full *years. We don't know our own fortunes is what I mean. Something could happen any *day to your or them also. So every *day with them is such a gift to cherish."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes totally, I agree. Super true."</Pp>
<Pp>"You should show me pictures of them!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sure. I've got some on my computering device. I'll zoip them to you." I pop a tablet of Grumbletine, my lunch digestion supplement.</Pp>
<Pp>"I bet those birds know as much about life as you do."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ch-ching!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. We've just been studyin different topics."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>Every *month I spend two hunks of gold on my subscription for the "Peaceful Calm, Beautiful, And Quite Tranquil" visual theme for my computerior. It makes the text appear in muted pastel tones, floating above sprawling green vistas and lapping waves.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: dinner would be great, actually</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'll let you know when I get off work</Pp>
<Pp>My digging for the error brings me to the RX knot, which is located in the medicine cabinet, obviously. I pierce the gooey film clogging the neck of this old Plumm Queam canister with my tongue and squeeze some of its nectar down my throat.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: Very good,</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: that way I can put the tangy toast in the oven.</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48 barges into my office. He's wearing a pastel pink microsilk shirt. He asks "Is this a good time?"</Pp>
<Pp>I shake my head. "Nop, I'm lost in the code world."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, understood. I respect that. I'll come back in a few *hours."</Pp>
<Pp>"Thanks. I appreciate it."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>Dimples supports thousands of devices. Each device comes with exceptions. Thermometers need to react correctly to atmospheric pressure. Surgical robotics need to account for the rotation of the earth in their calculations. There are a staggering number of variables to account for.</Pp>
<Pp>Our files don't include any notes or comments as part of a company-wide anti-context policy. Every device uses the same fundamental base of code, and including superfluous contextual data could significantly increase the uncompiled size of the program. It's already plenty big as it is. There's no way to remove any significant chunk of old code because the mammoth Tangle files make wanton references to one another. They wrap around each other and spill over each other. They are all individually described in the package directory, otherwise referred to as the map. There are many millions of files in the program. It's befuddling as hell.</Pp>
<Pp>If you haven't programmed before, it's like explaining a list of things to do line by line in a sparse, logically exact language for a robot. That list can diverge and loop-de-loop over and over like a ziggly roller coaster. It can zoom into other lists of things to do and can create lists of its own. Errors occur when the lists conflict or the instructions don't make sense. Hopefully that isn't a bad explanation.</Pp>
<Pp>The past two bugfixes I made yielded bugs of their own. I had to individually Multivaluate each conflicting variable. It took two *hours. When I looked away at the white walls of my office they had the wobbly pattern of scrolling text.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm sorry for not responding last night</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I hope you didn't take it personally</Pp>
<Pp>The bug reports describe the error as an IMPOSSIBLE_DIGITS exception for the variable CURVE_QUOTIENT. It occurred on line 495 of intensity-and-dosage.tangle, one of the largest files in the Dimples library. I triple click and highlight the whole line:</Pp>
<Pp>UNFRACTIONATE(0 ‚â• STATE[PHARMA[CURVE_QUOTIENT]] ‚â§ 1);</Pp>
<Pp>We just recently started using Dominators in Tangle. I don't really understand them. The zoips keep zipping through my umbilical data plug straight into my mindchip.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: alright sorry, but now two other values are disequalized</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: 5 to 9? i think</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm sorry, I'll get back to you</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: but right now isn't a very good time</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I hope work has been better for you today!</Pp>
<Pp>Dominators have to do with dynamic value control across equality networks. Some objects carry invalid values (informally referred to as "naughty data" at Dimples) that need to be dominated and restricted from proliferating through their multivaluation chains. For instance:</Pp>
<Pp>IF [NAUGHTY[CURVE_QUOTIENT]]!!:</Pp>
<Pp>CURVE_QUOTIENT === DOMINATE[CURVE_QUOTIENT, TRUE]</Pp>
<Pp>is the sort of line I'm searching for. I press the spacebar five times.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: would you be available to do something this *weekend??</Pp>
<Pp>My back feels sweaty against the chair. Nug20 sends me a zoip.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: How's progress on that hotfix man? We need that up tonight</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: Otherwise we have to postpone until Loyalday</Pp>
<Pp>I can't figure out why CURVE_QUOTIENT needs to be dominated. I'm trying to find examples of where else it's being used, for context. My search isn't yielding any results.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: ohh i guess one of the variables is just in a public knob. i thought it was private.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: Can you give me a solid estimate on how roughly long it'll take?</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm making progress on it right now</Pp>
<Pp>My right knee twitches. Humph. I type out another zoip but leave it sitting in the bar. I can feel a migraine coming on. A little glowing dot burns in my vision.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I can't keep making excuses on your behalf. Please tell me</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: that didn't fix anything though. hmm</Pp>
<Pp>I minimize my editor. The electrocardiogram window from yesterday is still open.</Pp>
<Pp>"Ch-ching!"</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm sorry, i don't mean to bother you. just let me know if you have any ideas! :~X</Pp>
<Pp>It flatlined. I close the window. If I can't trace the value of CURVE_QUOTIENT anywhere else then I can't determine why the data was naughty. It's common to find variables misdefined elsewhere in some other file, but generally a quick search comes up with those specific lines. I guzzle a thick gulp of Plumm Queam.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm filling out the code submission form for you so you can just upload it</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: as soon as you're done</Pp>
<Pp>I scroll through topics in the Dominator documentation. It's filled with links so I can learn the ins and outs of Domination. The migraine dot in my vision glows violet. It grew hands. I squint to read the text on the screen.</Pp>
<Pp>"Ch-ching!"</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: have to be honest Nug20 I am feeling pretty crummy right now</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: No time for that. Finish it</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: It's starting to smell pretty tangy in here!</Pp>
<Pp>I yank the data plug right out of my belly button. It's warm from use. The chatter drains out of my consciousness. I can focus regularly again.</Pp>
<Pp>I run some commands in a debug console. CURVE_QUOTIENT isn't visible in the intensity-and-dosage scope. I rub my right temple in slow circles. The light from overhead is so bright. I hear the ding dong of a Drip notification. I haven't gotten a Drip notification in months.</Pp>
<Pp>@3145948352 > EXPOSED: Dimples employee Jim29 03Goldman ([Mr Jim29 That'sme((]) reported as architect of zoftware crash that mercilessly slaughtered two</Pp>
<Pp>The drip already has ten thousand thumbs and four thousand flips. My eyes are blurry and my face is wet. Jittery energy pumps behind my brain. My throat pushes into my mouth.</Pp>
<Pp>@6276441179 > @3145948352 > disgusting</Pp>
<Pp>I skim through the code. Click between the tabs. Highlight letters, words, lines. I close my eyelids and sit in the dark. My head throbs throughout the room. I take short, quick breaths.</Pp>
<Pp>@14923567215 > [Mr Jim29 That'sme((] > worthless human being</Pp>
<Pp>@74629464215 > [Mr Jim29 That'sme((] > wish i could slit your throat myself</Pp>
<Pp>My celly buzzes around frantically on my desk from all of the notifications it's getting. It's already 2:00bt. My mind can't settle on any certain thought. I swallow air wrong and cough.</Pp>
<Pp>@84038204819 > [Mr Jim29 That'sme((] > Local harlots BEGGING to be your date! -- Click here for the sexy new adventure. tttp://h.ot/19489A9</Pp>
<Pp>"Ch-ching! Ch-ching!"</Pp>
<Pp>The fuzzy cash register noise blares through the speaker hanging above my desk. It doesn't have an on/off switch, it protrudes out of the wall. I step up onto my chair. A little bit unsteady. I rest my fingers around the plastic speaker. I smash my fist against the taupe drywall underneath it. My knuckles light up in pain. I pound my fist into it again and again. The crunching, brittle, hollow shudder. My vision fills with black fuzz. I feel the chalky drywall give way and yank out the speaker's TOTALNoise Cable. The skin on my index finger caught on a nail in the wall and it's dripping bright red blood. I don't have wirecutters or anything, so I dig into the cable with my teeth. I'm able to rip through its hard rubber casing but can't snap the metal tubing beneath. The wiring is slick with my spit.</Pp>
<Pp>I climb back down into my chair. The migraine dot's swollen. It's obscuring a third of my vision. I feel like I'm being smashed by a planet and shot through the head. I sob. My chest shakes underneath me. I wipe my drippy eyes.</Pp>
<Pp>"It's going to be OK." I say it so only I can hear. I rest my head on my arms and close my eyes. My celly keeps rumbling louder. "It's going to be all just fine."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>So the leaves are wet beneath my bare feet. The sky is smoking, the moon is finally full. And I'm on all fours running my hands through the brush. The vegetation is rubbery and cold. I can't find it. Mud cakes between my fingers. I start pulling up worms. They stick to the skin of my arms. They chew at me with their wet mouths. I shove my hands down deeper. "No no NO no no No no NO!!"</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>A rough hand jostles my shoulder. I open my eyes. Chadmuth48, the apparent jostler, is leaning in the entrance hatch of my workpod. My eyes are tender and crusty and my cheek slick with drool. It's sunset. My celly is quiet for half a *second before resuming its buzzing fit. The Chief Consumer Perception Director stuffs his hands in the pockets of his pink slacks. "You sleep well, pal?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I didn't realize I was sleeping. What time is it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"4:15bt. "</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh. Gosh. You ever have weird dreams?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I only have nightmares. Just swinging by to let you know I put out a press release. You catch that, by chance?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No."</Pp>
<Pp>"Alright, well it's on Drip. "</Pp>
<Pp>"Ah yah I guess I was getting a lot of notifications."</Pp>
<Pp>"Listen, champ. This is just how it goes. "</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The net can be a real meat grinder. People like to rip people up nowadays. They made it illegal to abuse and murder animals a few hundred *years ago and that's probably now our most comparable outlet. Human beings are natural hunters. Don't you love the sound of snapping bone? We love seeing faces curl up while they bleed. It is, quite frankly, the way we're wired. Definitely a bummer."</Pp>
<Pp>"Uh," I rub my sleepy head, "what are you talking about?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You'll want to turn off your celly for the whole *weekend I imagine. Don't go outside too much. You're a murderer now, so you're kinda kicked out of the human tribe. Don't give up. Things are going to get better eventually. It take a while. But I'm rootin for ya."</Pp>
<Pp> I cross my arms and lean them against the back of my seat. "I think I might need a *second to process. I'm...I'm really sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"Makes no sense to apologize to me! Did you finish the hotfix, by the way? Is that ready?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I can't figure out what caused the error."</Pp>
<Pp>"So, not ready?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm still working on it. Doing my best."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're such a cretin. Seriously, look at you. Slick with drool and snot, messed up hair, bad haircut in the first place I might add. How long were you asleep?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Um. An *hour I believe. You don't like my haircut?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You are a complete waste of a person. Just utterly miserable." He turns around to walk away. "Go talk to legal by the way. They've been tryin to get ahold of you." Slams the door behind himself.</Pp>
<Pp>I have the shivers even though it's warm in here. I'm feeling very dreadful. I boot up my celly and start scrolling through some of my top scoops.</Pp>
<Pp>But that's the thing, I can't read right now. Mr. Rony22 95Barnard is hollering again. I can't help but stare through the floor. He's running in circles, hands on his head, shouting things such as "PLEASE no no no, PLEASE PLEASE no no, NO! OH NO!!" His face is as red as Tomahto Queam.</Pp>
<Pp>He slams headfirst into the tan wall and collapses into a wriggling heap. I can see his eyes for the first time. They're bright brown and wide like he's about to get run over by a choo choo. It's not like I know who this guy is. I'm not invested in his well-being. He's a random person in my life that I see everyday but never talk to, one among the millions. But I hate watching him writhe like an eel down there. It's really starting to freak me out.</Pp>
<Pp>OK now he's on all fours. He's racing around the room on all fours like a canine. Tongue is hanging out too. He's struggling to itch himself behind the ears with his knee. He can't quite reach em. He's wearing dress pants and his butt is up wagging in the air. Now he's just licking the wall.</Pp>

<Pp>HOT NEWS: Dimples Releases Statement on zoftware Malfunction</Pp>
<Pp>by Tammy46 21Grumbo</Pp>
<Pp>It's one of the hottest stories of the *week. I need mitts to pick it up! Innovative health zoftware technology giant Dimples is currently dealing with a stinky rotten bug that has led to the deaths of two (2) normal people. And according to a press release from the company today, the glitch was determined to be caused by a wimpy scumbag mudsucker named Jim29 03Goldman. A statement from company rep Chadmuth48 23Shnozo is below.</Pp>
<Pp><em>We at Dimples are devastated to hear of the deaths of Murt62 79Shmanderson and Toyler58 28Bumperton. We hold human life in esteem, and the mission of our company is to protect and cherish it. Our team of engineers is working around the clock to fix this issue. We hope Mr. 79Shmanderson and Mr. 28Bumperton  find joy in the afterlife. Our wayward employee Jim29 03Goldman (age 24) created the bug and we are furious with him.</em></Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I sign into the computering device at the legal desk. The chairs for visitors are really modern and pretty hard on my back. I can hear the sound of shouting through the walls. My head pulses in pain. The receptionist must be doing something elsewhere. The room is empty. The overhead lights burn my eyes. I shake another Jubimum tablet out of the canister. I'll take three a *day on the dire occasions.</Pp>
<Pp>A woman trudges through the side door in a grey legal gown. She has short black hair and looks very tired. That's not a critique of her appearance, she just seems truly fatigued. "Mr. 03Goldman...?"</Pp>
<Pp>I follow her into the halls of the legal nest. The walls are covered in strange, menacing items. I spot among them bloody knives, frayed ropes, poisonous flowers, rips of papper, handguns, shotguns, rifles, body parts, etc. "What's all this stuff from?"</Pp>
<Pp>"These walls are covered with objects involved in intra-office crimes...employees harming other employees mostly...usually small disputes...it is all dealt with internally."</Pp>
<Pp>I spy a grenade taped to the ceiling.</Pp>
<Pp>"Have you committed any other crimes...that would not show up on an exhaustive background check?...answer as best as you can." Her voice makes it sound like talking is an ordeal.</Pp>
<Pp>"That question kind of makes me feel weird. Is your job to defend me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I need to make it clear...that I am not representing you in court. My job is only to ensure...that certain aspects of your employment contract with Dimples are upheld...also you will have to forgive me, I do not think I introduced myself...my name is Nera16 93Huszh."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nice to meet you. I'm Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"For the sake of full disclosure...you should know that I know exactly everything about you...I read about you all through the night."</Pp>
<Pp>"Is there that much to read?" The room is lit in a Jubimum glow.</Pp>
<Pp>"Please Mr. 03Goldman...no funny business...there is a lot of importance at work here, and the importance here is placed now on the facts." She looks at me the way one looks at a pedestrian blocking traffic.</Pp>
<Pp>"Have I committed a crime? You need to tell me. Even allegedly or whatever?? Does what I did count as manslaughter?"</Pp>
<Pp>She gazes at me impassively.</Pp>
<Pp>"Come on! Oh my God! Please tell me. I've been so so worried."</Pp>
<Pp>"The deaths resulting from your operational oversight are registered as 'corporate casualties'...which means you, along with Dimples at large, are protected from potential litigation...the courts will not judge you...the burden is strictly for your conscience to bear..."</Pp>
<Pp>This is excellent news. Really tremendous and wonderful for me to know. "OK. Alright, so what aspects of my contract are you concerned about me upholding?" Super great, wow. I happily scrape some drool crust off of my cheek.</Pp>
<Pp>"Let me just say it this way...you are at the center of a very, very, very large public relations dilemma...not good at all."</Pp>
<Pp>She opens the door to her office. It's positioned above the north play room. I watch through the floor as employees chuck inflated multicolor balls at each other. They're Amusement Studies interns. They're mostly sons and daughters of accomplished Dimples executives. Once they complete their internships they'll presumably be offered comfortable administrative roles. The glass floor is very thick but I can at least imagine their laughter.</Pp>
<Pp>"The bottom line, sir, is that you, to some extent...represent this company. We, as a corporate entity, and a dominant force in national trade, absolutely cannot let you cause any more damage to our dynamite brand identity. That would be NOT OK!! GOT THAT?...surely you must understand...that you will need to alter numerous elements of your lifestyle...to fulfill our requests."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, mhm."</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you paying attention currently?"</Pp>
<Pp>I look up at her. My eyelids feel heavy. "Yah for sure, sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"This is very serious...you do not have time to watch them toss the balls..."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry, I'll admit I was watching but I  promise I was listening too."
"Here is the thing...people already know what you look like. They know what you did...they know oh 'Jim29? He is not a good guy'...some of them might want to hurt you with their hands, and that is just the way it goes..."</Pp>
<Pp>The shouting through the walls is sounds more like screaming. I'm starting to feel fairly weird. My heart is racing. "I don't really understand what you're getting at."</Pp>
<Pp>"If you would just let me finish..."</Pp>
<Pp>"It really seems like you're just trying to make me feel scared."</Pp>
<Pp>"I am very sorry, that was not my intention...here is the deal...when you signed the employment contract you agreed to Article IX. Do you remember what that article entails?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I actually don't. They wouldn't let me read the contract."</Pp>
<Pp>"Article IX is an article which...to make a long story short...restricts how you represent the company, in this case...the company being Dimples." She really hammers the "D" sound each time she mentions Dimples. "You cannot disparage Dimples...you cannot criticize Dimples either...and most importantly I would say...you are not allowed to act in any way that reflects poorly on Dimples, OK?" Her eyes are pale blue. "Of course, one could argue that you have <em>already</em> reflected extremely poorly on the company..."</Pp>
<Pp>I feel a particular migraine spike on the right side of my head. "What do you need me to do?"</Pp>
<Pp>The glowing Market Megasphere passes through the evening sky behind her head and makes her face difficult to make out. "As it stands...your living and breathing poorly reflects on the company...you're very, very toxic, is I guess what I mean to explain. Your face...is synonymous with the death of innocent people. And as of right now, we can't just have you out and about...talking to other people...getting your hair cut...going to the Food Dome...seeing a rock &#x26; roll performance...blah blah blah, such things like that. Do not get me wrong...we're not going to kill you, god no, nuthin like that...we're just going to have to put you through some identity resculpting..."</Pp>
<Pp>She slides me a brochure. It's printed on heavy stock papper that has a plastic sheen. The design is modern and sleek. It outlines The Four Easy Steps to Resculpting Your Identity:</Pp>
<Pp>STEP ONE: NAME CHANGE</Pp>
<Pp><em>[the icon for this section is a quill drawing an X] </em></Pp>
<Pp>The first step of the identity resculpting process is to change your name. Make sure you pick a new name that you are very happy with! You will be given a new driver's license, passport, social security card, birth certificate, name badge, and shirt with your name screenprinted thanks to our partnership with ShirtDonkey. Try practicing that new name in the mirror tonight. Our Name Change team will personally burn all of your old identification materials. Good riddance!</Pp>
<Pp>STEP TWO: SOCIAL DELETE</Pp>
<Pp><em>[the icon for this section is a filing cabinet knocked over]</em></Pp>
<Pp>Next, we"ll run your old information through a script our Social Delete engineers cooked up that individually terminates each and every one of your social media accounts. All your drips, flips, drops, and flops, gone in a flash! We will generate new accounts for you under your new name using photographic images we render of your body and data we gather from your resculpting questionnaire. We'll work hard to make sure that your new accounts are a perfect fit for someone like you.</Pp>
<Pp>STEP THREE: FRIEND RESET</Pp>
<Pp><em>[the icon for this section is the recycling symbol with a person inside of it] </em></Pp>
<Pp>Your friends are going to wonder where you are. You can't tell them about any of this. They can't know that you still exist. You can send out your own custom final zoips to each of them individually, or you can use one of our award-winning final zoip templates. They might miss you, but it'll be fine in the long run. You're all going to forget about each other. And once you've executed a total Friend Reset, you can use our excellent FriendSearch zoftware (patent-pending) to meet new companions that are your age and living in your area. That shweet!</Pp>
<Pp>STEP FOUR: APPEARANCE SWAP</Pp>
<Pp><em>[the icon for this section is a trash can filled to the brim with clothes and stink lines float above it]</em></Pp>
<Pp>Last but certainly not least, you'll need to shake up your look. Studies estimate that by the age of twenty-five, two hundred thousand people remember what you look like. In order to finish your complete resculpting, our licensed Appearance Swap designers will give you a head-to-toe makeover so you look like no one ever. Welcome to your new you!</Pp>
<Pp>"FYI, we don't really do it in that order...we start with your appearance, and will work on the rest of it over the next couple of *weeks...but that's an outline of how it works."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're serious?"</Pp>
<Pp>She slides a folder over to me. "Yes...this is not a comedy prank...this is standard procedure at all the great big companies these *days."</Pp>
<Pp>I flip open the folder.</Pp>
<Pp>"Your new name was algorithmically generated to be stylish, funky, and 'totally you.' Your first name is now Bunndy...two n's...and your last name is Fludge. Your registration numbers are 009 and 35."</Pp>
<Pp>"Bunndy22 is my name now?" I pull out my birth certificate. Sure enough.</Pp>
<Pp>"It's short for Bunnson22."</Pp>
<Pp>"Interesting, I've never heard of someone named Bunnson." I lift up my new driver's license. The 3D portrait barely looks like me. My hand shakes.</Pp>
<Pp>"It's been a popular name...very handsome, and much lower registration number than you had before...virtually zero downsides in this fantastic deal...we also included your social media questionnaire underneath your new papperwork..."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can I request a different name?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, sorry, much apologies...this name was generated specifically for you."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why would I ever want the name 'Bunndy22'? That's a name for an idiot."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's not up to you. It's up to the algorithm."</Pp>
<Pp>"You can't do this to me. This is insane."</Pp>
<Pp>"This is a new chance for you...you can start over." Her eyes don't move at all in her sockets. She just stares.</Pp>
<Pp>"But things were already OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"With all due respect, Mr. 35Fludge..."</Pp>
<Pp>"Shut the fnuck up."</Pp>
<Pp>"...with all due respect, Mr. 35Fludge," she pronounces with a strangulated groan, "this is inarguably charitable...if we were to fire you, no other company would hire you...and that is skipping over the fact that you have already broken our contract...you could never pay enough to fix what you caused..."</Pp>
<Pp>My blood swells in my veins. "I can't believe you're serious. I don't even know what to say." My stomach bubbles like a cauldron.</Pp>
<Pp>"I am sorry...you agreed to these terms..."</Pp>
<Pp>"SHE NEVER LET ME READ THEM!!! That can't be legally binding."</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course it can. Anything can be legally binding if you sign it with a quill."</Pp>
<Pp>I feel fluid push up through my throat. I turn over the side of the chair and retch a jet of warm chunky red vomit out of my mouth and onto the floor. Same color as Razzberry Queam. "I hate you. I hope you get ripped apart by wanderers." It burns in my esophagus and nose. "I hope they rip you apart and smear fresh putty in your wounds."</Pp>
<Pp>"You'll need to visit Mr. Glem22 21Ninkus, fourth floor, northeast quadrant, pod Z923...he is our in-house Appearance Swap designer..."</Pp>
<Pp>I don't say anything. I gag as some more red acid lurches past my tongue. Stringy drips of it hang from my lips. Silent for a few *seconds.</Pp>
<Pp>"Sometimes I wonder what they think down there as they throw those colored balls back and forth...all *day, they just throw them at each other...must be nice I imagine..."</Pp>
<Pp>I breathe in halting gasps. "Is Mr. 21Ninkus's door on the left or the right side?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It is at the very end..." She pushes her glasses up on her nose. "...I'm very sorry."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I've been thinking about my expression: where my eyes are placed, where my mouth is placed, what my eyes look like. Soft and rubbery, soggy and blank. That's who I am to every other person. I walk for a while, take a slide, do some more walking.</Pp>
<Pp>Glem22 21Ninkus swings the door open as soon as my knuckles make contact. His head is completely obscured, densely wrapped in black cords roughly a quarter inch thick like a rubber band ball. They shift and wriggle as he moves through space. "Bunndy22! Do I have that right?"</Pp>
<Pp>I elect not to respond.</Pp>
<Pp>"Glem22, nice to meet ya." His voice is gruff. We scan each other's fingerprints. His hand is soft and warm, his grip gentle but firm. "You're the one in need of some resculpting?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I guess."</Pp>
<Pp>"You can take a seat. I'm just getting my equipment set up."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do I have to do this? From a legal standpoint?" The chair is wooden and rigid. My body feels foreign, like I'm actually located two inches below where I was sitting.</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes sir!" He wheels out a large amorphous white machine with a hefty touchscreen on its side. "This is just normal corporate procedure. You'll be back to living like normal in no time."</Pp>
<Pp>"What are you going to do to me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm just going to use this Dimples FaceFriend to get some measurements. We'll factor them into generating your outfit."</Pp>
<Pp>"Interesting. How does the algorithm generate outfits? Like, what sorts of data does the FaceFriend collect?"</Pp>
<Pp>A human face-shaped indentation sinks into the side of the machine. Glem22 beckons with his fingers. "Would you mind squeezing your head on in there?"</Pp>
<Pp>I get up out of my chair. "No problem."</Pp>
<Pp>The white indentation is cold, soft, and wet, like strange foam. I ease my face into it, feeling it grip my features. It gets tougher and tougher to push forward. My head's in past the ears. The foam jiggles and pulls my skin in different spots. I can hear the machine's whirring in my head. It feels like my whole skull is getting kissed.</Pp>
<Pp>The texture of the foam turns hard like concrete. It pushes in from all angles, slowly at first. It squeezes my features and bends my bones. The pressure is excruciating. I shove my hands against the side of the machine but my head's totally stuck. It pushes in heavier and heavier, crushing my muscles and breaking my bones. My legs spasm and kick the floor. I squeal and shriek but it comes out gurgling. It pushes my eyes closer together. It pushes my mouth farther down. It pushes my cheekbones up. I hear crunching and snapping. I can't say anything to describe the pain. At a certain point I don't feel any.</Pp>
<Pp>After a *minute of crushing the machine lets go of my head. I droop down to the floor limp and whimpering with blood dripping out of my mouth and nose.</Pp>
<Pp>He gestures to the machine. "This baby's actually running on Dimples Z21. Kind of cool to think that some of your code probably helps it kick into gear."</Pp>
<Pp>My temples throb enormously. Vision is blurry.</Pp>
<Pp>"I tell people we're just going to take measurements because it's always easier if they don't know what's in store. I hope you can forgive me, sport."</Pp>
<Pp>I feel my face in my hands. It's covered in a smooth, soft synthetic material. I can open my mouth and breath through my nose. The contours are someone else's.</Pp>
<Pp>"We start you off with one of those plasticky things to make sure your face doesn't reject its new shape. Think of it like a cast for your whole face."</Pp>
<Pp>I lie face down on the floor. My skin is void of sensation.</Pp>
<Pp>Glem22 makes an effort to be cheerful. "I have your brand new outfit picked out for you! I think it'll look really special."</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>"It's a blue unisuit with a pink shirt. And a bowler hat, to boot."</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>"I understand if you're not much of a hat fella. I just thought it was a little snazzy."</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>"You sure you don't want to try it on?"</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>"I'll leave it hanging on the hook here. Does that sound OK with you?"</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>"You're going to have to get up at some point. Act like an adult."</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I look at myself in the mirror while I wizz in the urinal. I aim around and splash my wizz against the floors and the walls. The yellow fluid flows through the cracks in the tile. My whole mug is dark purple with wounds. My cheeks are more angular and my jaw is more boxy. My eyes are smaller and closer to the bridge of my nose. My ears are lower and my lips are thinner. My head is less heart shaped.</Pp>
<Pp>The unisuit they gave me is pretty big around my arms. I left the hat in the trash. My hair is stuffed under a short blond wig. It takes a couple *seconds for me to pin on my new name badge.</Pp>
<Pp>A custodian crawls in wearing a loose-fitting robe. His face looks battered and his hands are ripped at the knuckles. He's carrying a dirty wet auto mop.</Pp>
<Pp>I scream at him. "GET OUT! NO! LEAVE!"</Pp>
<Pp>He scampers away on all fours.</Pp>
<Pp>It feel like I'm spying on someone through their own eyes in the mirror. I look disgusting. I wash my hands and I scrub really hard with the soap.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: Is it OK if we take a rain-check on tonight?</Pp>
<Pp>There isn't much of anyone left in the office. People leave early on Respectfuldays. Probably to get a headstart on the <em>weekend. I wish I had cool </em>weekend plans. That would make me feel much better. I need to spend less time alone. The only noise is the clomp clomp of my dress shoes. I can stare through the floor into the foyer without spotting a soul.</Pp>
<Pp>I have my bag packed and my fluffy coat and hat on. The fluff's a bit matted down from going down the slides. I turn on my lantern and push open the double doors into the cold pitch black outside. I'm parked on the second level. The concrete is coated in a thin sheet of ice. The cold made my whole face burn. It made my body weak. My eyes were thin slits from the swelling. Moving my lips hurt horribly. I try humming to myself. Just some little melodies.</Pp>
<Pp>I cast my lantern's pale golden light over my car. It has a wide glow that reached about five leaps away from me. I shiver and shake in my seat.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: is there any way I could still see you tonight?</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : I don't think I should be alone.</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : is that messed up?</Pp>
<Pp>"Hello Mr. 35Fludge!" Tulip sounds on edge. "Are you going to be driving Jim29 home this evening?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You know it's me, Tulip. C'mon! I'm Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"Your vocal timbre is quite similar. However, your name badge says that you're Mr. Bunndy22 35Fludge, and your facial ratios are completely different. Besides, I'm pretty sure Jim29 wouldn't wear an ugly unisuit like that."</Pp>
<Pp>"No, no, I'm actually me. How can I prove that to you? I just had to have my identity resculpted today. I didn't pick out the unisuit."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh is that right? I guess I have been hearing a lot about you online lately. Seems my fashion sensors need to be recalibrated. Your unisuit looks smashing."</Pp>
<Pp>"Thanks. It's me, I promise."</Pp>
<Pp>"In either case, I should still call you Mr. 35Fludge then."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you just call me Jim29? Please?"</Pp>
<Pp>"But that is not your name."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jesus. Just let me drive. I want to go home."</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: nevermind, sorry. hope you have a good night</Pp>
<Pp>The engine slowly hums on. Tulip lets out a huffy sigh. I cautiously curve around the tight corners of the ramp, trying to slow down as much as I can without relying on the brake. Tulip handles really poorly on the ice since its chassis is made of triple-constituted ultralight plexifoam. I'm almost always skidding.</Pp>
<Pp>"How was your *day otherwise, Mr. 03Goldman?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Pretty good."</Pp>
<Pp>"What all did you do?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Fixed and put out a patch for the bug. Had some conversations with some friends."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm happy to hear that!"</Pp>
<Pp>I pull onto the highway. The wind howls against the side of the speedster. Its headlights are dimmed by the cold. Black hail pelts the windshield.</Pp>
<Pp>"How was your *day, Tulip?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What did you do today?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't understand what you're asking, sir."</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you just sit in your parking notch and do nuthin all *day?"</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes, that is what I did. Do you have any more questions?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, I was just wondering."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>How'd you get all the way over here Boom? Yah it's me, Jim29, don't worry. I'm going to look a little different from now on but that's just how life goes. Did you have a nice Respectfulday? Don't you get tired climbing around your cage with just your toes and your beak? You're so curious. Aren't you! I love the way your eyes move around. You always look so puzzled.</Pp>
<Pp>Little Buzz always get about three *seconds of seed for dinner. I just shake it like that, one-two-three. She always knows when it's time to eat. I feel like she's the one that really watches me. *day in and *day out she lurks in the corner of her cage, glowering at me. Must be trying to figure out what I'm up to. What're you thinking about Buzz? What do you think of me? Ha ha. When she runs her beak through her feathers she's cleaning herself. She must think she's pretty dirty. I love you Buzz! You know I do.</Pp>
<Pp>I wish I knew the shape of your thoughts. I wish I knew what they sound like. When you look in your mirror, why do you think that other Buzz acts just like you? What's your explanation? I suppose it just IS, and there's nuthin wrong with that. Aren't we all, little buddy. We all are, ha ha.</Pp>
<Pp>You see that little mirror hanging in the back corner of her cage? With the little bell hanging off of it? I used my experience working on that Dimples ReflectionCam to rig up tiny cameras that analyze the birds' eye movements. The camera sees through that tiny hole in the bell. An algorithm crunches their eye movements into motion vectors and dynamically analyzes whether or not they've recognized themselves in the mirror. If they do recognize themselves, it's rigged up to automatically open the gate to the their cage, granting them freedom and independence. I slapped the bellcam system together a few *weekends ago. I bet you're thinking that's the kind of thing a weirdo does, and you're probably right. It's certainly a philosophical preoccupation of mine, I think about it a lot. And regardless it's not like I have friends who want to hang out.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: Oh gosh, is something wrong?</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: yah.</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : but I'm sorry, I didn't mean to guilt you or anything</Pp>
<Pp>Look, Boing just climbed up on my arm like that! So sweet. He's already starting to trust me. If you look real close you can see his feathery chest rise and fall. What goes on in that little head? Some pretty big stuff, I imagine.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: No, don't worry.</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : I just got kind of freaked out seeing all of the stuff on Drip.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I understand if you want to keep your distance.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: No no, that was messed up of me. I'm sorry.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: don't worry bout it</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : I've just been having a hard time</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: Would you like to come over around seven?</Pp>
<Pp>Aah Jesus Boom!! Stop yelling! That was right in my ear! No! Bad! Bad boy!</Pp>
<Pp>When I carry him back to his cage for time out he always tweets the prettiest whistles he can think of, hoping they'll change my mind. That is still bad behavior! He's a manipulative little scoundrel. I can't let myself be vulnerable to his persuasion. We'll reconcile once he serves his penance.</Pp>
<Pp>My celly is ringing, but I don't recognize this area code. Most of the voice calls I get nowadays are robots that just hang up immediately. "Hello?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Is this Jim29 03Goldman?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. How did you get my number?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I can't wait to wrap my hands around your little neck tonight. The last thing you'll taste is my hot sour sweat."</Pp>
<Pp>The line goes dead. I guess he hung up.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: yah, that should work for me</Pp>
<Pp>I sit on the circular couch watching teevee. The couch is circular, shaped like a donut, and I'm the filling. My celly vibrates on the cushion. It's been buzzing nonstop. Completely sucks to use. I'm currently watching a news program called "Smiling *hour" brought to you by Ha Ha Entertainment. This reporter always picks very tender stories. Generally they warm my heart. The film is filtered to look especially rosy. Two friends are walking, arms around each other's shoulders.</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm his best friend."</Pp>
<Pp>"And he's mine!"</Pp>
<Pp>The camera flips between their faces at canted angles as they laugh.</Pp>
<Pp>"We do everything together."</Pp>
<Pp>"We couldn't live without each other!"</Pp>
<Pp>They're standing beside each other before an oceanfront cliff's expanse. Their long hair blows in the wind. It's a majestic shot even though they've shivering. The reporter steps into view. "But their friendship is even more than it may seem."</Pp>
<Pp>Friend 1 sits on a bench in a gazebo. "Every *day he gets covered in putty. I don't know how it happens. I look away for one *second and boom, now all of a sudden he's caked in man mud. Head to toe."</Pp>
<Pp>Reporter is across from him. Lit brightly from above. "And you always clean him up?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course. I wad up thousands of tissues and wipe him up."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why do you do that for him?"</Pp>
<Pp>"He's my friend. I stick up for my friends."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The city is a neon hell this time of night. Multiple levels of highways are backed up around skyscrapers lit in glaring hues with rail tracks zigzagging vertically between. Each speedster has its own muffling plume of black exhaust. They speed up and slow to a stop, bumper to bumper, jittering forward like segments of a mechanical caterpillar low on battery. The flow of traffic can cease for *minutes at a time. I don't roast coal every time this purple one in front of me does, because they're about to slam on the breaks. That's a waste of carbon energy. I tend to wait until there's a significant enough gap in front of me before rolling forward, but I'm sure that behavior ticks off the people behind me. If everyone simultaneously chose to stay in place until the traffic cleared, no one would ever move. Our humanoid reflexes are dangerously clunky, and our driving system doesn't accommodate for mistakes. Any moderate error incurs vehicular damage, monetary loss, and/or bodily harm. I lurch forward and grind to a halt, over and over.</Pp>
<Pp>[ This following section is going to be optional, some kind of footnote addition or something since it's pretty indulgent, haha ]</Pp>
<Pp>The other *day I read an expos√© in an internet magazine called Crash: the End of the Self-Navigating Speedster. Apparently much of the publicized dissent for intelligent navigation systems was organized and funded by GRIP, the Guild of Restraint and Immobilization Professionals. Recognizing that self-driving speedsters would dramatically limit both highway collisions and the consequent appeal of restraint and immobilization systems, they funded the production of multi-camera sitcoms, dramas, and soap operas featuring hard-working, blue-collar seatbelt and airbag manufacturers.  </Pp>
<Pp>Near the end of teevee capsule 2 segment 3 of Each Of My Sons, Norman18 45Northam takes long pulls of dizzy drink sitting on the hood of a wrecked sedan. Chatham55, his thirteen-year-old boy, was in the front seat of the self-navigating family vehicle when the GPS malfunctioned. It veered into the community brick wall at ninety twentyleaps per <em>hour. "I sew fifty airbags a *day," Mr. 45Northam rants. "Only one of those suckers could've kept your grey brains from splattering all over that dam windshield. Only ONE BAG!" He dips his fingers in his child's coagulating blood and spills bubbling dizzy drink down his shirt. "If God wanted speedsters driving independent, I think..." (gurgling, loud thunder overhead) "...I think he'd have given them brains HIMSELF!" He is howling and screaming incoherently as the tears roll down his leathery face.</Pp>
<Pp>I hate driving. I hate being wedged in front of and behind and next to people whose one sleepy mistake could grind my body into burger meat. I hate the way my bum feels after sitting for an *hour and a half. I hate seeing their faces as they merge into my lane with their open mouths and sweaty foreheads and unfocused eyes. They look like rubbery tired frogs. They look just as nervous as me. Not encouraging.</Pp>
<Pp>I roll up to the highway intersection. Five lanes on both sides. I almost doink into the rear of the guy in front of me. His bumper sticker says HONK = SCREAM and every half *minute or so he honks. Speedsters race through the intersection while we wait at a red. I'm trying to not think about anything but I keep thinking about not thinking. I feel like I'm swallowing too much air when I breathe. My phone is still vibrating on the passenger's seat. The clock says it's 6:30pt. Looking in the rearview, the swelling really has gone down a lot. I still look purple but not nearly as puffy.</Pp>
<Pp>The sign fades to black and a red dollar sign appears next to some red zeros. I yell at the top of my lungs. A full-throated shout from deep in my gut. I've gotten three super reds this <em>month, and we're only two </em>weeks in!</Pp>
<Pp>The zeros climb up to about seventy gold nibs. Two more *minutes pass. I boot up the NeatStreet program on my celly and contribute twenty.</Pp>
<Pp>[ Hidden snippet/footnote ]</Pp>
<Pp>Here's the thing, like, I understand that maintaining the roads is an expensive task. But we already have high income tax and sales tax, and we're on Tier 2. Some people around here don't make much. Why would they hold us hostage for funds when the Apex Tier creeps directly above us have castles made of gold? It's senseless.</Pp>
<Pp> That's why I donate a decent amount, to support those who can't. I don't go overboard or anything, but I contribute more than average.</Pp>
<Pp>I stuff my hands between my knees and shiver. Three more *minutes pass. I put Tulip in park and turn off the coal. The sky is empty darkness.</Pp>
<Pp>A woman carrying a burning torch wanders toward Tulip. Her skin is translucent blue in the flames' glow. Runny saliva trickles down the edge of her tongue. Her face sags like it's melting. Her voice is light and feathery. "Honey! Excuse me honey! Oh honeyboy!" Her eyes are wide like they no longer close. She peers in through the windshield, looking at my body. Her smile seems very genuine. "I have a story to tell you. Don't you want to hear it?"</Pp>
<Pp>No interaction. That's the rule. I stare straight forward and hold my breath.</Pp>
<Pp>She smashes her raw knuckles against the front left window. She laughs very shrill without pulling her tongue back into her mouth. Her eyes dart up and down. She scrapes her teeth against the glass and claws at the door handle with her sharp fingers.  She shrieks "OPEN THE DOOR!!" Her eyes cross outwards. The sides of buildings light up to display commercials from high end brands. "LET ME IN!!!" I sink down into my seat. She whispers in a raspy seductive trill. "Please let me in, sir." Her teeth are cracked and sharp, jutting out from behind her lips at different angles. "Please let me touch your skin?"</Pp>
<Pp>The pressure in my distorted face hurts terribly. The plastic layer over my skin is so tight.  all the way up to twenty nibs. Her fingers rubbing against the window are thin, wiry, and raw. Her body snaps with energy. She furiously slams her fist against the glass. Cracks spider through it. "I WANT TO SWALLOW YOU!!"</Pp>
<Pp>The goal of three hundred gold nibs is finally reached. The sign lights up green and GO. I'm able to make my head totally empty, no thoughts at all. She laughs while I drive away.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I knock on their cubby door. The number is 4931W. The nameplate says Neher31 11Yately. There's some rustling behind the door. It swings open.</Pp>
<Pp>"Hey. What can I do for you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It's me. Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"Goodness gracious."  Their auburn hair hangs past their cheeks. The way their lip curls up when they see me makes me feel pretty bad. They're wearing an apron that says "Cooking Currently".</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry that I look so weird."</Pp>
<Pp>"Is all that permanent?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I think so."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well, come on in!  You can put your shoes on the hanger to your right."</Pp>
<Pp>There's some ancient piano music playing through their speakers. The gentle twinkling keys are emphatic and flashy. I think the pianist just did a glissando? I think that's what a glissando is. They have so many paintings, mostly landscapes, hanging from the walls. Some of them are nature scenes, some of them are city scenes. "Heh," I say, "You know what?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What?"</Pp>
<Pp>I smile my widest. "With songs and paintings like these, I'm starting to think life can't be all that bad."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, I guess. Could you shave some maize?"</Pp>
<Pp>I start shaving the maize. It's an especially juicy cob. My eyes water. "Did you have a good *day?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah! It was really nice. I did some exercise and chores, volunteered," they make a huffing sigh, "signed some petitions, called my parents."</Pp>
<Pp>"Where sorts of volunteering do you do?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I recently started helping at this non-profit called Kids Roll. I blow glass to make marbles for mid-income children. They love their marbles. It's so fun using all the different of colors and patterns. Sometimes I'll use swirly black, grey, and brown so it looks like the planet."</Pp>
<Pp>"Glass blowing sounds like it'd be pretty tricky to do."</Pp>
<Pp>"I've literally burned my knuckles so many times. It's worth it, though, to see the looks on those kids' faces, knowing that they're going to get some marbles."</Pp>
<Pp>I slice through the layers of juicy cob. "It would be cool to get a marble."</Pp>
<Pp>"How's that succulent doing? The one I sent you a few months ago?"</Pp>
<Pp>"He he. It's doin fine, since it's made of plastic. I named it Genius."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah it did seem pretty smart come to think of it." They crank the heat on the stove. "What was your *day like?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't really want to talk about it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you at least give me the short version then? You made me really worried."</Pp>
<Pp>I'm at kind of a loss for words. "I don't know if there's a short version."</Pp>
<Pp>"Your skin's dark blue. You look like a freak of nature no offense. What happened to you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"If you must know..."</Pp>
<Pp>They nod largely.</Pp>
<Pp>"...Dimples backed me into a corner and I agreed to a bad contract. I'm currently being forced by the corporation I work for to abandon my whole life. Lots of people on the net want to hurt me badly. My face got forcibly rearranged in a horrible machine and my new name is Bunndy22."</Pp>
<Pp>"Never met someone named that. Is it short for something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yop, Bunnson22."</Pp>
<Pp>"Dam. I'm really sorry to hear that."</Pp>
<Pp>I look out the window. It's still hailing. The buildings gleam like teeth in a wide dark mouth. "That's just how it goes."</Pp>
<Pp>"Does your face hurt?" They stare at me. Their gaze is piercingly studious. "It looks horrible."</Pp>
<Pp>"That hurts my feelings. Please don't say stuff like that. I had a bad *day and I'm feeling sensitive."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry, that makes sense, my bad."</Pp>
<Pp>"Whole face feels really numb right now, like it's someone else's skin. It's soo gross."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you have to wear that unisuit? And that wig?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I think so."</Pp>
<Pp>"Were you able to fix that bug I've been hearing about?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"At least there's that."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you think happens when we die?" I look in their eyes. "I don't think I've ever asked you."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hmm. In what sense? On a per-person basis?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. Do you think it all just goes black? And the game's over?"</Pp>
<Pp>They toss my slices in a pan with some sizzling lard. "I don't even think it'd even be a black. More like no color at all."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wait, so you think after life it's just nuthin?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I mean, I'm not sure. I'm not making any conclusive claims."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you think there's such a thing as hell?"  I rub my new forehead. "I've been worrying about it nonstop all *day."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well do you think there's a heaven?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Just because there's a hell doesn't mean that there's a heaven!!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Jim29, you have to settle down. You're not going to burn in hell."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're right, I'm sorry." I close my eyes and try to clear my mind again; no dice. "Sorry. Aah!! I'm being so weird."</Pp>
<Pp>"No dude, it's OK. Seems like you're in a weird place."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sometimes I get this problem where I start thinking about my breathing over and over. I have it right now. It's like I get off rhythm. I take breaths too long or exhale too short or vice-a versa, you know."</Pp>
<Pp>"Never heard of that."  They reach into the oven and pull out a wide metallic tray supporting a syrup-drizzled scorched hog.</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, it sucks really hard. I can't figure out how to stop. The gas builds up in my belly and the pressure's awful. The only way I can get it out is by burping and farting over and over. Breathing starts to feel like when you're driving and you think about how you're driving too deeply." I pull in a long, slow breath. "You ever feel like that? Like in an instant the task seems impossibly hard and I'm definitely going to crash. I've been worried I'll run out of air."</Pp>
<Pp>"Your body takes care of that on it's own. Is there anything that'd help you calm down? I have plenty of dizzy drink if you want some."</Pp>
<Pp>I nod.</Pp>
<Pp>They fill up two glasses with the bubbly blue stuff and hand me one. "This stuff is called Extended Nipple Zap. Local recipe, pretty interesting flavor. Let me know what you think. I picked it up at the gulping den a few *hours ago, and on the way out a hunched over old lady dropped a mitten. She was so grateful when I handed it to her. She had such beautiful green eyes! I love cute moments like that. I've been thinking about how glad I was to be right there right then."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's cool."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's a nice thing that happened to you today?"</Pp>
<Pp>I burp. The drink is pretty strong. "I can't think of anything."</Pp>
<Pp>Earnestly: "Well, I'm really glad you're right here right now."</Pp>
<Pp>"Tight, tight." I tap my fingers on the counter like I'm a drummer in a great band. "I feel totally hideous."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's not your fault."</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you hungry?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Mhm."</Pp>
<Pp>They arrange huge hog chunks on beds of maize. I pull out my chair. The smells are sweet and savory. The hog face stares up at me. It's grinning and looking real beaten up. Its four eye sockets are vacant, and the skin around them looks to have been blackened from some sort of impact. The stereo stopped playing music. It must've reached the end of the disc. There's a slimy green slug underneath the table. What the hell! Ha ha. It slowly squelches across the floor. My swollen plasticky lips are hard to open wide. "By the way, I can leave whenever you want me to."</Pp>
<Pp>"What? No, you're fine."</Pp>
<Pp> "I've been having a really hard time being around people. It's so hard for me to think of things to say." I scrape a forkful of roasted meat out of the hog's smiling mouth. Drips of fat slide down the edge my fork. "It's as though I only think of garbage. I'm rotting---" (significant burp) "--inside my own brain."</Pp>
<Pp>"Have you been attending your appointments with Dr. Samantha?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, every other session or so." I chew with vigor. Of course it tastes wonderful. Neher31 makes great food.</Pp>
<Pp>"I think you should make your mental health a higher priority."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah yah, I know." I release a gentle fart. "Do you think this sweethog was laughing when it died?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Mm. Probably."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. I think so too."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you like it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Totally!  Was just about to say, delicious!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Terrific! I worked on it all *day.'</Pp>
<Pp>"Your work really paid off."</Pp>
<Pp>"Is there any chance you sent me a note on Fog earlier today?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No. Why do you ask?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Because it's anonymous. I don't know who sent it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well yah, of course. And I appreciate that you would even trust me to answer that kind of question truthfully given that you have no means to verify. I didn't send anything though."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can I ask why your celly keeps vibrating?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Net weirdos found my info and keep dripping my number. Freaks have been calling me nonstop."</Pp>
<Pp>"How do you know they're freaks if you're not answering? What if someone's calling about something important?"</Pp>
<Pp>I pull it closer to my plate. There's another boogery slug crawling on the wall behind their head. What is up with those. It's leaving behind a thin green trail. "The first one I answered made me feel really scared. But I guess I can try answering this one." I tap the green button and crank up the volume.</Pp>
<Pp>"Greetings?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hey."</Pp>
<Pp>"Could this be Mr. Jim29 03Goldman?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, that's me."</Pp>
<Pp>"I go by the name of Boyce38 52Sminsel. Perhaps you've seen a few of my bylines?" His voice crackles with sass and verve. "I'm an esteemed journalist for an astonishingly important online journalism website called 'Funny Laughs, Hot News, and Cool Trivia üôÇ'. Ever heard of us?"</Pp>
<Pp>"For sure, absolutely! Wow."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm working hard on a very crucial piece about you, Mr. 03Goldman, and . Indeed, might you spare a *minute?"</Pp>
<Pp>I look up at Neher31. "Would you mind if I take this?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No worries, you're good." They smile, a warm one.</Pp>
<Pp>I walk out of the cubby and stand in the hallway. I don't feel comfortable talking on the celly near other people. "Hey! Sorry bout that. What were you wondering?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I suppose I'll take it right from the top of the top. What's your reaction to the last couple *days?"</Pp>
<Pp>I lean my back against the wall. I think it's important to really pause to collect my thoughts.</Pp>
<Pp>"It's been really hard. I'm honestly struggling to think of how to talk about it. I never meant for any of this to happen. My world's been <em>very</em> topsy turvy. My feelings change from <em>hour to </em>hour, but mostly I feel really horrible. I'm trapped in a cage of despair and self-loathing. It's a mistake I'll regret for the rest of my life."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hmm. Very interesting. Would you describe your reaction to the last couple *days as being like Hubba Hubbaüòç, Whuzza Wha?üò≥, Yuck Machineü§¢, Hellz Yesüòé, or Fail Monkeyüôà?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh...well...Fail Monkeyüôà, I guess."</Pp>
<Pp>"That makes sense. What do you think when people say you're a murderer?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'd like to clear that up. These deaths are considered 'corporate casualties,' so I did not commit a crime. And even if I did, it isn't my fault!! OK? Their machines just stopped keeping them alive. And, actually, hmm, I don't know, is there any way you could just not print this answer, I'm just--"</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you think Whuzza Wha?üò≥ or Hubba Hubbaüòç?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh, right! I think Whuzza Wha?üò≥"</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you feel sorry for the families of the victims involved in this nightmare?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hubba Hubbaüòç. Wait, I mean, Hellz Yesüòé."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's your opinion on the rumors that this whole scandal was manufactured by the government to distract us from far worse news pouring in from the approximately eight hundred ongoing violent conflicts that our military is currently engaged in around the globe? And that you're an actor under a fake name in a well-orchestrated hoax or possibly even some sort of artificially intelligent computering beastoid launched here through a psychic ripple in timespace?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What? Can you say that again?"</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>"I mean, either Whuzza Wha?üò≥ or Fail Monkeyüôà I guess. Was that real? Do lots of people think that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Pineapple on pizza?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yuck Machineü§¢."</Pp>
<Pp>"Boxers, briefs, or panties?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Uh, boxers."</Pp>
<Pp>"So Hubba Hubbaüòç boxers?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, I think so. By the way, if I gave you a statement on this whole thing, would you publish that? I just want to say sorry to the people I've hurt."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hmm."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't want people to think I'm a monster."</Pp>
<Pp>"Actually I think that'll be enough, Mr. 03Goldman. Thank you for your time."</Pp>
<Pp>I try to say "thank you, too" but he's already hung up. I stand in the hallway for a moment and let my mind do a jumping jack or two. I'm starting to get a little dizzy.</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 is still sitting at the table and chewing. "That wasn't long. How did it go?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't know." I sit down and scoot my chair forward. "Probably OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"Poured you another glass, just in case you want some more."</Pp>
<Pp>"Thanks." I take a sip and stare a hole in the table. I close my swollen eyes and tap the tines of my fork against my teeth. "The bug wasn't my fault. I swear it wasn't. There's just so much code and it's all written in this prehistoric language. It's so impossible to understand."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gotcha."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you believe me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Why's it impossible?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Imagine zooming in on a tiny particle of fructose with an electron microscope. There's all those structures holding it together. Such a small thing is so meticulously structured. Maybe if I could fully understand why those protons, neutrons, and electrons stick together in their special way I could eventually understand what makes em taste sweet. But I have deadlines, I need to make decisions, and things slip through the cracks. I can't know how my additions affect everywhere else in the system. And the unexpected is fatal.</Pp>
<Pp>"I keep pondering that kind of infinite vertical complexity, wondering how I fit into it. Is there any way I can? Massive designs poke through the clouds while I warm up my snacks down here so far below the heavens. Every waking moment demands such strenuous mature deliberation, but you can't do the right thing because, I mean, every single thing that can be done is already inherently wrong. Every breath I take I'm sucking out of someone else's lungs. Surviving some *days feels like crawling around a big reconfiguring labyrinth on my belly. They take my gold and exhaust my body and make my commute to work longer all so they can develop more unique ways to blow people up hundreds of twentyleaps away. I got disfigured this afternoon and honestly, I'm doing pretty alright, from a statistical standpoint. I'm not bleeding out or thrashing in the water, I'm not scattered ash or stuffed under the mud.</Pp>
<Pp>"Every *day I loosen the squeezing rope around my belly two other people's ropes tighten. That's one thing I'm sure of. I wish I could step somewhere that wasn't also onto someone else's head, you know? Every single choice any of us makes has a concrete effect on how many more or less people will die. But I only just know it as numbers even if I make the effort to read about it online. Every pair of eyes is a universe and if I consider even one of those shutting forever my brain feels like it'll pop.</Pp>
<Pp>"You ever watch that evening program on TOTAL Access Channel 4? 'Birth Rate/Death Rate'? The birth rate on the left is always faster than the death rate on the right, but not by much. The population count in the middle is always flickering, jumping a couple hundred, dropping a hundred, shooting back up again. I just imagine all those grown hearts stopping and all those new hearts starting. Gasping and crying in either circumstance. People sliding into life looking as bloody as they'll leave it. How many of those people were ready to leave? Did they get to say goodbye? I can't help but laugh when I watch it. It makes me giggle and I feel like a sicko. Would it be better if I cried?</Pp>
<Pp>"And I know that none of this is new. Everything is really old, and speaking is wasting time. Which is why what I mean to say is, hmm, I don't know. I don't know about anything at all. If you think about anything enough it starts to seem impossible."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 claps their hands together twice really loud. "Wake up! You're in a world of infinite flavor!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Isn't that a big part of the problem?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I think it's honestly probably the only truly good thing left. Existence would be so meaningless if we knew everything or remembered anything. The gaps in our comprehensions are what make life worth breathing for."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you not talk about breathing if at all possible? I don't want to get off rhythm again."</Pp>
<Pp>"But do you get what I mean though? The sun feels a lot warmer in the nasty summer if you'd forgotten it over the nasty winter." Their eyes are like flowers. "The world's so endless that you could learn something special every *day and still be a bit of a dummy. An enriched dummy!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you hear about the first Guns in the Sky launch the other *day?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"So there are thousands of long guns now floating in space ready to blast us apart for whatever reason."</Pp>
<Pp>"But they won't be able to see us through the big black clouds."</Pp>
<Pp>"The guns have lips. They can blow the clouds away."</Pp>
<Pp>"But we keep learning! We know more now than we've ever known before. We have such an amazing collective potential for good. Every *year we get kinder. We're going to get where we need to go. And in the meantime we can listen to music and hang up paintings and water plants and cook meals and try our very best."</Pp>
<Pp>"I just don't think that's logical. I don't think there's any evidence that things are getting better. I think that's an invalid model we use to reassure ourselves."</Pp>
<Pp>"Shut up." They set down their fork. "You can be such a snouch sometimes."</Pp>
<Pp>"The sea levels are above our curbs and the storms keep getting worse as we irradiate the oil choked soil with new bigger bombs but I'm sure the folks getting incinerated right now in white hot light are very glad about how optimistic you are."</Pp>
<Pp>"You get so much joy out of describing how bad it is, flexing the vocabulary. Like it's exciting, like you're the only one who's ever realized it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you believe me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"About what?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I asked you if you believed me earlier, that it wasn't my fault, and you didn't answer."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh, yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"Come on. Do you believe me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't know! I'm worried about you! Your face is all smashed up!"</Pp>
<Pp>I crush my glass straight into my face and feel it crunch into shards that split through the plastic and carve into my skin. I dig the shards in with my palm. "I GIVE UP!!!" Blood bubbles down over my eyes. I jab the cracked stem of the glass deep into my forehead until I can feel the skin break.</Pp>
<Pp>They stare at me.</Pp>
<Pp>I shout it again. "I GIVE UP!" My brain feels tight. "I just want to sleep. I just want to wake up where everything is different. I can't stand being awake."</Pp>
<Pp>They're looking anywhere else.</Pp>
<Pp>"How productive is your line of thinking?" I point my finger right at them. "None of our toiling makes any progress. We eat, drink, and breathe poison every *day. No one's coming to our rescue. None of us are making it out alive."</Pp>
<Pp>"The kids like it when I volunteer."</Pp>
<Pp>I crawl down onto the floor and collapse in a heap. My face is soggy in a puddle of blood and tears. When I breathe the soupy mixture ripples. "I'm sorry. I'm being such a goblin."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"I should stop it though."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"It is really cool that you volunteer."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you zoip me some netgold to pay for that glass you smashed?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sure, no problem."</Pp>
<Pp>"Also can you get up off of the floor? I don't want you falling asleep there."</Pp>
<Pp>I sit up on my butt and tease glass bits out of my facial skin. "I don't want you to hate me."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't hate you." They sit down next to me and run their fingers through my hair. "Promise."</Pp>
<Pp>"Thank you for being so nice to me."</Pp>
<Pp>"I want to make sure you're OK." They look me deep in the eyes.</Pp>
<Pp>"You're good looking."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nice, I think you are too."</Pp>
<Pp>We grab each others' faces and our tongues coil around like snakes. I can feel the wetness of their mouth and the smoothness of their teeth. They squeeze my ears and suck harder. Their neck is long and bony. I can feel its discs. I lick their face right on the cheek. They bite my nose.  </Pp>
<Pp>I pull away. "Can we stop? I keep thinking about being crushed by an enormous hammer."</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course. Dam. I'm sorry to hear that."</Pp>
<Pp>"I think I'm just being dramatic."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think any of this is your fault."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's OK if you do."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's up with all the dam slugs around here?"</Pp>
<Pp>They stand up. "Don't ask me about the slugs."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why not?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Seriously, don't." They scrape their plate into the trash pit.</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>They scrape my plate into the trash pit.</Pp>
<Pp>"I want to go outside."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, let's go outside."</Pp>

<Pp>Skimming:</Pp>
<Pp>Here's what Mr. and Mrs. 28Bumperton Did Every Sunday</Pp>
<Pp>by Pnicholas45 20Luther</Pp>
<Pp>According to an anonymous source who cannot be named, Mr. and Mrs. 28Bumperton, of Dimples Disaster fame, had a ritual every Sunday afternoon. They were a different kind of couple. They had values.</Pp>
<Pp>Toyler58 would stand up on stage and look down at her. He would read from a list he had compiled of every time he had thought about her throughout the past *week. The park was so pretty at that time of night.</Pp>
<Pp>"While reading online news, while cooking my corn meal, while walking down the street, while wizzing in a urinal, while looking at birds," he stops to catch his breath.</Pp>
<Pp>They'd paint flowers in the woods. They'd set up their canvas in front of their latest specimen. She'd draw the lines and he'd fill them with just the right color.</Pp>
<Pp>They would sit out on the hill and watch the setting sun and it crept down the horizon. it'd be so warm. They'd take their shirts off and lay on the grass in each other's arms.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>We take the stairs two at a time. Their hand is warm and soft. The steps are deep and not quite wide enough. I can feel those dizzy spins. I'm having trouble thinking of what exactly to say, but I'm enjoying trying to figure it out in my head. Flight after flight of stairs.</Pp>
<Pp>I scan my face and order us two choo choo tickets. The system assigns us fourth class seats after calculating my *yearly income and cheerfully greets "Good evening, Bunndy22 35Fludge." The cabin is clean and comfortable.</Pp>
<Pp>"When I commuted to the Knowledge Dome I always had to ride eighth class," I say.</Pp>
<Pp>"Huh. How was that experience?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It always smelled like sweat and recent puke." The coal roars and the train starts rolling. "They'd always search our bags. I think they were looking for drugs. Sometimes they'd slam us against the wall and choke our necks."</Pp>
<Pp>"I can only imagine." They run their fingers through their hair. "Have I ever told you about the time I got sick?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>We get up from our seats and transfer to the turquoise line.</Pp>
<Pp> "Remember way back, before the first Great Freeze, when there were still mosquitoes?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"So I'm ten *years old riding a ferris wheel, and a horse mosquito the size of my fist lands on my shoulder. Sucks up a cup or two of my blood before I can even notice. I don't think much of it. Next Thursday I ride an ambulance from the Knowledge Dome to the hospital. I'm sweating, I have the chills, I can't stop throwing up all over. The hospital is dusty, rundown, and the only one in the region with any open space. Doctor takes some cultures and diagnoses me with double malaria. That was that kind that was super resistant to antibiotics, you know? Sure enough, my organs start failing."</Pp>
<Pp>We get up from our seats and transfer to the khaki line.</Pp>
<Pp>"Man, you never told me about that. How do they treat that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Within a few *days I end up on life support. Can't hear anything over the whirr of machinery. Big fat tubes pump air into my lungs and blood through my veins. Most of my muscles aren't responding. The best I can do is open my eyes every now and then, enough to look around the empty room I'm in. I get pretty used to the idea that either my life would end or wouldn't get much better. One or the other.</Pp>
<Pp>"A scene's seared in my memory where I can see my parents, eyes gushing, talking with the doctor. My mom turns, says I love you, but I can't hear it. They leave, and the doctor leaves. It's just me and the dust they kicked up. It has that look in the mid-afternoon sun where each dusty little particle lights up and sparkles. I try to follow one with my eyes and see where it ends up. They swirl and collide like they're dancing. I decide that I don't want to stop seeing things, and I shut my eyes closed."</Pp>
<Pp>We get up from our seats and transfer to the salmon line.</Pp>
<Pp>They look nervous all of a sudden. "Is this an engaging story?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, why?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You just haven't said anything."</Pp>
<Pp>"Only cuz I'm listening."</Pp>
<Pp>"As luck would have it, a couple <em>weeks pass and there's a speedster crash. Two people're carted into the ICU completely ripped open, but their organs are in good shape. The surgeons slice a long slit through my abdomen and rip out my belly, kidneys, heart, and 'testines, all chalky and yellow and spurting fluid onto their scrubs. They swap in a new set they yanked out of the crash victims and staple it all into place. They even leave me with an extra heart. That's why my chest thumps twice as much. Just a few </em>weeks pass and I'm able to breathe and run and laugh again."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's nuts." I think about my breathing again and feel the slow rising of my chest.</Pp>
<Pp>"But do you get what I mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh I thought you were just telling a story."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, I probably should have been a little more obvious. What I guess I was trying to say was that those machines were all that was keeping me alive. All my parts were busted! And you work on those kinds of machines every *day, making them better. Y'know? People really need people like you, is what I mean. Because you're smart and you care."</Pp>
<Pp>The train rolls to a stop. I put my arm around their shoulder. We walk beneath the cloudy night sky. The rocky path is littered with broken canisters, plastic bags, and stamped on printed out online scoops. The frozen black ice of the ocean looks like an endless chasm stretching out to the horizon. We sit down. They place the lantern gently in front of us. The gooey darkness continues to recede.</Pp>
<Pp>I ask politely, "Can I tell you something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"For sure. Spill it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nah, I shouldn't say it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Come on you dweeb!!"</Pp>
<Pp>My cheeks are warm. "No, I really shouldn't."</Pp>
<Pp>"Please tell me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, fine." I look them right in the green eyes. "I love you."</Pp>
<Pp>They go quiet and rigid. "I wouldn't say that I love you back."</Pp>
<Pp>The wind howls. They're looking anywhere else. We shiver in the cold.</Pp>
<Pp>"Why not?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"
"Why don't you love me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What kind of question is that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't know!"</Pp>
<Pp>"You want me to tell you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. Hmm. Well, you're so self-centered."</Pp>
<Pp>"You think so?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. And you're so eager to please. But I think that's just because deep down you're afraid of being abandoned. You want people to depend on you. At the same time, you feel so much contempt for people you've never met. You get so angry when people aren't cynical in the precise way that you are. Your morals are so confusing. So often you're just actually unkind. And when someone points out that you're being unkind, you're always surprised like oh, this is so completely new to me. Your whole belief system hinges on you being the most virtuous person, the most authentic person, the sweetest person. I don't really even get what you want out of this world. You never really try at anything and you hold yourself in such high esteem. Like, everything about you is so suffocating to be around sometimes. Makes me want to throw up."</Pp>
<Pp>I scratch my frozen eyebrows. "Is there anything you love about me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sure, of course."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you tell me what those are?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I love your smile. You have a really nice laugh too. You're a really great listener, and you're there for people when they need you. You desperately want to be a good person. You know exactly what you think about everything and you know exactly why."</Pp>
<Pp>"...Is that it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, why?"</Pp>
<Pp>"That list is a lot shorter."</Pp>
<Pp>"Quality versus quantity."</Pp>
<Pp>"I have a much longer version of that list for you."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher99 cinches their hood tightly around their face. "I don't want to hear it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"You know what my favorite bible verse is?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think so."</Pp>
<Pp>"Genesis 2:19. 'So out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.'"</Pp>
<Pp>"My name is Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think we'll go to hell when we die. Or heaven. I think we'll just start to float forever."</Pp>
<Pp>"That just sounds like heaven, muchacho. Except in heaven you get wings."</Pp>
<Pp>The ground trembles. It throbs and roars enormously beneath us. They grab hold of my midsection. The sound is a deafening growl, it makes my ears sting. It's a sound that can devour the sky. I bend over and cover my neck. The soil shudders, metal screams as it bends. They're squeezing tightly. I forget to breathe.</Pp>

<Pp>"Can you hold the lantern for just one jiff?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sure thing."</Pp>
<Pp>"The screen isn't reacting at all. I can't type in my keycode." The LED buttons are freezing cold and I give up. The gooey night continues to melt away, slowly revealing more of the train station's metaminimal architecture. None of the lights are lit. The air stinks of burning. The rails continue where the terrace ends, stretching over an impossible-to-see-across bottomless gorge open wide like a hungry gullet. "I wouldn't be surprised if the power's out. Can you pull up the nation map?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Ah doink, I'm reading Drip right now. Not good stuff. Magnitude six quake, about four thousand confirmed dead. Jesus."</Pp>
<Pp>"Quit saying his name like that."</Pp>
<Pp>"Whose name?" They look puzzled. "Wait you mean Jesus?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Whom else could I possibly be referring to?"</Pp>
<Pp>"That makes literally no sense. You <em>proclaim</em> his name in vain all the time."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well, OK, maybe that's true, but do you want there to be another earthquake?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What on earth do you mean? We're right next to the Eternity Faultline. There's been so much drilling over there. You seriously think that was just god rustling the world around with his divine paws because he's mad or something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm superstitious, maybe. Suspicious. I don't know."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's completely absurd. You're doing yourself a disservice by believing things like that."</Pp>
<Pp>"I respect you opinion." I think I'm the one guilty of acting like a nut in this instance. "The entire choo choo system is shut down and I'm honestly freezing my butthole off already. Maybe I'm not thinking straight. Do you want to talk about something different?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you pull up Nation Map Extreme?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I told you to."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why not just do it yourself?"</Pp>
<Pp>"My celly's almost dead. 7% voltage."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why didn't you charge it like an adult?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You're being mean as hell for no fracking reason."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nation map says We're on Tier 2, Terrace Star-Star-Octagon, surrounded on all sides by that Tier 3 gorge. Apparently the bed of the gorge two hundred feet down is Terrace Star-Circle-Octagon, Tier 3, people call it Stinky Town. My flat in Big Town is sixteen twentyleaps north. I don't have a lot of unsponsored data left, so you better appreciate my generous sacrifice."</Pp>
<Pp>"I do, I promise. But what you're saying is there's no other way back besides down? Not even a bridge or something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yup. There's a ladder a couple hundred leaps north."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hooo-mama that sucks."</Pp>
<Pp>We trudge northward. I am feeling highly ill at ease. "How long do you think until we get frostbite? Are we gonna freeze out here?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Look how fluffy you're dressed! You'll be fine."</Pp>
<Pp>Tonight feels especially dark. Our lantern rocks back and forth like a pendulum along the arc of its handle, metallically whining.</Pp>
<Pp>Minutes pass and I keep talking a little more. "I'm sorry, I gotta stop acting like such a jerkoff freak. What's wrong with me." I convulse in full body shivers. "I shouldn't have drank so much. I still feel so dizzy."</Pp>
<Pp>"Me too."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry for how unbearable I've been."</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't worry about it, you got smashed so much or whatever that you have Blooberry skin. You're in pain. It's OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"Alright, cool."</Pp>
<Pp>"Also it says that apparently this earthquake is named Travis."</Pp>
<Pp>"Earthquake Travis huh? Kind of a nice name."</Pp>
<Pp>We hold hands. I tell Neher31 about how much I wanted to puke my guts out Thursday afternoon when I got the bug report. They nodded and I think they might've listened. Either way I did a pretty good job of telling the story.</Pp>
<Pp>The metal rungs of the Descent Station's ladder descend out of a wide pipe reaching over the edge. In times of emergency anyone can use an Ascent/Descent Station ladder for tier traversal, but it's important to keep in mind that getting spotted on a tier above that which is designated by your social code is not only a huge faux pas, but the No More Upsters bill that passed last month made it a national offense punishable by incineration. I'm putting a lot of effort into making it seem like I've climbed down a ladder this tall before. I adopt a wide and confident stance along with super gentle, calm breathing. The wind roars and buffets my chest.</Pp>
<Pp>I ease my shaking feet down onto the second and third slippery rungs, which are formed out of an oddly thin and rough material not unlike that of a public bench. It's a struggle to find the next foothold, but I refuse to look down into the sixty leap depths below me. I'm relying on my scrawny tired arms to keep me suspended as I picture my fingers unwrapping from the metal, the rush of air as my body yanks me heavily down, the collision with solid earth, the way my face crunches into my chest or my knees into my shoulders or my chin into my tush. My eyes point straight forward. The cliff face is rough sandstone and thick red ants scurry up and down its surface. As we climb I tell Neher31 about the dreadful silence sitting on the bleachers mid-Morning Chat, about the cement slowness of my meeting with legal, about the very specific way my skin and bones felt crushed in the resculptor. It gets harder and harder to think of the details while hanging in the middle of my lantern-lit sphere of orange light, surrounded by an icy abyss, but I consider myself a pretty gifted storyteller.</Pp>
<Pp>"Hey Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I have to close my eyes. They're getting rock hard."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. It is pretty effed up how cold it is. Are you enjoying my storytelling?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I can't feel my legs."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah you're right. The cold is sucking the spirit out of my bones."</Pp>
<Pp>"It hurts so much. It's so cold that it flips into being warm, kind of."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, absolutely. I'm slightly scalding."</Pp>
<Pp>Clunk, clunk, clunk. Hands and feet against metal.</Pp>
<Pp>I raise my heavy brows. "It's not really that bad actually, once you get used to it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, I guess. It's not terrible."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'd like it if it were warmer, but this isn't the end of the world."</Pp>
<Pp>"By the way Jim29, I can't see anything. My eyes are totally shut. If I slip and fall, I'll probably knock you down too."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nuthin I can really do about that, I don't think."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, I'm just saying."  I can hear their hoarse breathing and shivering teeth. "Good to keep in mind. Do you want to know what that Fog note I received this morning said?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, sure, I'm curious."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. I memorized it this morning. It said:</Pp>
<Pp>neher31, you are disgusting.you are completely worthless and your brain is made of putty.if you slit your wrists or drowned or got run over or shot thru the brain no one would even realize.it would feel so good to crunch your ugly face in my hand</Pp>
<Pp>and so I kept hearing that in my head all *day."</Pp>
<Pp>"Huh. Yah. Stay off the net."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The ladder is jammed stuck at the bottom against a clumpy brown mound swarming with more thick ants. I lower my shaky foot onto its frozen surface. The lantern illuminates a well-stomped trail down the mound's slope into the bed of the gorge. My muscles ache with wiggly tiredness. There's not even a breeze. Yellowing bones from unknown bodies jut out of the terrain. Some are spiky, some are round.</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 drops down. "So this is terrace Star-Circle-Octagon." They blow warm air on their raw hands. "There should be an Ascent Station about a twentyleap and a half north from here."</Pp>
<Pp>"Shh. Listen to that."</Pp>
<Pp>"Listen to what?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Nuthin at all, I mean. It's so quiet down here. Isn't it amazing?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I have tinnitus. The ringing just sounds especially loud."</Pp>
<Pp>"I didn't know that. Is it genetic? Or from exposure?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Congenital, passed down from my dad. Kind of a generational thing. Can we start walking again? I really want to be home."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah no, that definitely makes sense, absolutely."</Pp>
<Pp>A twentyleap isn't that far, and a couple is literally only a bit farther. My thoughts are feeling quiet like a church. The mound is icy-slick as it slopes downward. I slip once and nearly plop on my rump. Neher31 leans forward like they're there to catch me but not enough that they'd be able to break my fall; it's more of a symbolic gesture.</Pp>
<Pp>A young girl is sitting among a pile of grey rocks in the distance. A torch is burning on the ground near her criss-crossed legs. As we walk closer, she appears to be wearing four or five layers of hooded sweatshirts and a metallic helmet that looks to be one size too big. She is humming a song from an advertisement to herself. I can't fully remember the product it was an advertisement for, but it's a nice song. The thick overlapped sweatshirt sleeves make her arms look very wide and stumpy. She places her hands on the side of her face and shrieks. It is bloodcurdling. Once she's done, she says to us, at a more respectable volume, "Honie honie honie honie. Zeep zorp flarfny snert."</Pp>
<Pp>I stop walking and whisper "Oh my gosh what the hell."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 shoves me lightly, whispers back "That's gorgespeak. You've never heard about gorgespeak? Don't you read lots of online scoops?" They squat down to look into her eyes and enunciate very slowly. "Hello," (waving at the girl) "do you..." (pointing at the girl) "speak..." (motioning to their mouth) "Central Standard?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. Hello." She slides her eyes around in her sockets in an effort to thaw them. Her voice is raspy and her accent is very round and bright, like that of a newscaster. She speaks with dignity and bravado. "Well the truth is, everybody calls me Mjmubhe__."</Pp>
<Pp>"What are your registration numbers, Mjmubhe__?"</Pp>
<Pp>"She's unregistered," I butt in. "That's obviously not a federal name."</Pp>
<Pp>Them: "You can talk to her then, since you're mister world's hugest genius."</Pp>
<Pp>Me: "My tone was rude. I'm sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>Them: "Don't apologize so much. It's not a big deal."</Pp>
<Pp>Me: "What am I supposed to do then? I just want to resolve the conflict."</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__: "To tell you the truth, Grandpoppie is sick, and dying, dying very quickly. Will you help him? Toss me a bone, wouldja?"</Pp>
<Pp>We both look back at Mjmubhe__. There isn't much of an expression on her face. The top layer sweatshirt she's wearing says "KILL://PUREGORE.SNUFF" and underneath, "#1 Beheading Catalog In The Cybersphere. LIVE Vivisections Streaming Now, Slit Throat, Organ Removal, Ripped Apart Bodys [sic] Free Trial Sign Up Now, No Bull$*!t, Just Dismemberment."</Pp>
<Pp>I recall the halcyon gore *days of my youth, watching sites like Pure Gore, Chop Time, and TubeMurder. I actually didn't realize there's electricity down here. That means her grandpap is probably using a Dimples machine. I hold the lantern away from me so she can't see my face wounds. "Can I make a deal with you, Mjmubhe__?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Indeed. Good deal."</Pp>
<Pp>"If I treat your poppie, will you guide us through this scary gorge?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"Where is he?"</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ clutches her torch and wobbily stands. "He's sleepin like a baby back home. I am thankful thankful as I could ever be, love your kind help. Stupendous." Her stride is loping and fairly brisk. She guides us over jagged outcroppings only half visible in the murk. The ground is menacing, littered with ants, meaty decaying skeletons, rusty personal blades, pill bottles, fool's gold, and sharp half-eaten cans of frosty golden creamed kernels. I really have to watch my step.</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 is still shivering quite a lot. I'm a little nervous about their comfort. "What do you like to do for fun, Mjmubhe__?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Grandpoppie always tells me no playtime. I am always working. He is the wisest man I've ever met. He says if there ain't quite enough gold for bill payment, we gettin' chopped up by the big terrible nutjob freaks reb rabba zorp and made straight into sandwich meat, is what he always tells me."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31: "What do you do for work?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I play *day in and *day out on the seesaw."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jim29 and I both love the seesaw too."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh, how I hate the seesaw. I have nary a soul to seesaw with. All alone. Not even anyone to talk to, besides momma of course. Alas if we are lacking seesaw power, we cannot pump water, zilch, might as well be pumping dust, understand? The special seesaw is a water pumping kind, and a gift from the entrepreneur charity. How stupendous." She stumbles over a threatening crag. "Grandpoppie needs brand spanking new water all over his body, at all times, every *day."</Pp>
<Pp>"Mjmubhe__, may I ask you a question?" I ask. "What is your grandpop's ailment?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Poor man stepped on a nest of small crawling ants. Next thing you know, they chewed him head to toe, munch munch crunch. And guess what, body is now filled up to its brim with venom. At least running water soothes. We have so many seesaws but no ant exterminator. What's the deal with that." She pushes open a mossy iron door. Her cave home is warmly lit and messy and dirty. There is a large fire burning in an alcove set into the wall on my right and I wonder how it's ventilating. A woman who I presume is Mjmubhe<strong>'s mother walks into the light. She is frail and wrapped in a soiled full-body scarf, which I discern through my formidable speed reading skills is embroidered with the fulltext details of an already-held sweepstakes to win tickets for an all-expenses-paid luxury virtual cruise through the tropical North. As an unregistered, it's not like she would've been eligible anyway. Her eyes are wet and red-rimmed. It looks like she must have done a lot of crying a bit ago. She glares at Mjmubhe</strong>, places her hands on the sides of her face, and shrieks.</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe places her hands once more on the sides of her face, and shrieks.</Pp>
<Pp>The mother does not appear to be happy. "Honie krinky dink?" She says her words with great resentment. "Zibby dipadap vooop vip vrump."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gromemo momo spebbo zimt eee yoop," explains Mjmubhe__, sounding calm and deferential. "Yaba Grandpoppie bong." She turns to us. "Follow."</Pp>
<Pp>The floor cords lead toward another iron door. Mjmubhe<strong> struggles to swing it ajar with her short padded arm while still clutching a very active torch, but she needs no assistance. The door creaks resonantly and the room behind it is filled with the dim blue and pink glow of lifesaving technology, whirring noises, and muffled human groaning. Mjmubhe</strong>'s grandfather is floating in a plexi-glass chamber all wrinkled and wiry, his naked skin narcotizing and decaying in blackened patches that look like diseased burns, tubes running in and out of his nose and his mouth and his anus, his eyes locked shut in suffering, his limbs wriggling and dancing in a seemingly unsuccessful attempt to calm or punish his firing nerves. The only light in the room is coming from the Dimples logo on his All-In-One Life Sustainment System Z20 Extreme, which I suspect is pearl-white under its brown layer of accumulated sediment. I started work at Dimples around the time we were shipping out the Z23 Extreme, but this model is still a few months away from total obsolescence.</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you have the 40-digit PIN number for this machine?"</Pp>
<Pp>She blinks at me. "Explain PIN?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It should have been on the box. Do you have the box?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I sleep on that box every night. Very sturdy."</Pp>
<Pp>"The specific box that your grandpop's equipment came in? From Dimples? I need the PIN number to run diagnostics."</Pp>
<Pp>"No no no." Her tone is frustrated. "I have simply have no PIN!"</Pp>
<Pp>Passwords for Dimples machines are allowed to be a maximum length of 32 case-insensitive alphanumeric characters, excluding any special symbols. If I just had the PIN I could boot past the password screen and reset the machine, but instead I'm left to doing guesswork. I type in all my default password ideas: "1234", "123456789", "abc123", "dimples", "123dimples"...Each incorrect guess is met with a startling "DOINK!" noise from the system's speakers. The keyboard is grubby and sticky with dirt and bug slime. Grandpoppie thrashes in the water like he's getting eaten up by piranhas. I keep typing and pressing return. "DOINK! DOINK! DOINK!"</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 puts their arm on my shoulder. "It's OK if you can't fix it."</Pp>
<Pp>"DOINK! DOINK! DOINK! DOINK DOINK!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sure I can fix it. I just need to get access."</Pp>
<Pp>"DOINK!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you get access without making that hellacious racket?"</Pp>
<Pp>"DOINK DOINK!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think there's any other way. It's a system noise, so I can't turn the volume down. I'm sure the engineers had a reason for making it so loud."</Pp>
<Pp>I take more time to think between my guesses. Still: "DOINK!...DOINK!...DOINK!..."</Pp>
<Pp>I forget to even type anything in before hitting return. It makes a beautiful boingy boing noise and a loading screen pops up, informing me that it is Scavenging For System Dump, Please Sit Still A Few *seconds. The account's password must've just been blank. I didn't even know blank passwords were allowed. The loading animation depicts a very small man pushing an even smaller rock up a little pipsqueak hill. He just can't quite seem to push it all the way to the top without losing his grip. The stone rolls very quickly all the way back down over and over and over in fluid vector animation. I wish it would just show a percentage instead. *minutes pass by.</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ is walking around in a circle, stepping one foot in front of the other, arms outstretched for balance. She must have placed her torch in a wall mounted sconce. Neher31 is on her celly and scrolling, eyes darting up, down, zigzagging around.</Pp>
<Pp>The loading man finally rolls the stone all the way up to the hill's apex. He looks triumphant before instantly fading into the black void of the command line.</Pp>

<Pp><strong> >></strong></Pp>
<Pp>This might look like just a bunch of hogwash to you, and it's OK if it does. The command line (or the console, or the shell) is like a conversation portal ON the computering device WITH the device, spoken in its special computational tongue. You can tell it to do things and ask it questions. It is good at talking so long as you know just what to say. Anything can be done through the console, which is a thrilling idea to ponder. But however, if you don't know the language, it might as well be a big old pile of baloney!</Pp>
<Pp>At the beginning of our exchange, the shell delivers its ritualistic greeting. One very interesting factoid is that the text of that greeting was generated by our data steward using a proprietary Dimples module called Ear2Ear. System engineers designed the module to help Deward translate condensed logical network data into Central Standard-encoded human language. On occasion it'll glitch out and get totally messed up, but it works most of the time and the console supports a lot of handy commands. I don't think Deward likes me, and that's fine, because I detest Deward. It tries to personally tailor its text to suit how it thinks I think, but, well-intentioned as it may be, it has this strange abrasive personality, and it speaks in halting unpleasant phrases, and I still have no clue why it colors certain words the way it does. Most of all I hate it when Deward tries to bust out some slang.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: what's all this about this bug of yours killing people?</Pp>
<Pp>On the first line with the arrows (>> means the spot where I can start typing) we ask what files are in the current directory. Some stock commands require certain "courtesy keywords" -- these were introduced by Dimples as a way to try to reduce hardware abuse rates at the company. Apparently over the *years it grew common for some of the stronger, taller employees to respond to a failing test or confusing error by crushing their computeriors' screens between their biceps or furiously body-slamming them into the floor. *years have passed and hardware abuse rates haven't dipped at all, not even slightly, but now if we were to remove the keywords it'd break a million or so different scripts we have running in the server barn, so, here I am, still having to tell Deward PLEASE and THANKS. There are a handful of folders in this directory and a couple files. Dimples installations always get dumped into the "default" folder, I guess because no one ever bothered to rename it. There also seems to be a duplicate install of Dimples here only because the installation workers we have at the company are smelly, aloof ding dongs morbidly fried out on scary recreational chemicals.</Pp>
<Pp>That wasn't very nice of me to say. That's not the kind of thing I think very often. On line 2 we CLIMB INTO the /default folder. I like to imagine the computering device hoists itself up into the folder with a rope and a snug harness. Note my courteous tone, THANKS. It's really hard to concentrate with Mjmubhe<strong> vocalizing another advertisement anthem, this time singing the lyrics for the SplishTime Broop, a half-broom/half-mop with a wide, enchanting smile and a bulbous chin (the lyrics for the commercial's song chant cheerfully, over a bed of warm electric maracas, <em>Swoop swoop swoop/Quick as a Broop/All the grinky and goop/Yabba dabba dee doop</em>) and Neher31 is still muttering quake statistics under their breath. Mjmubhe</strong> is doodling a lovely 3D-printed plexiglass cottage tucked between the cement supports of a blocked-off expressway ramp, tracing her unsteady lines with a black surgical marker on the back of a red-lettered medical debt bill. Neher31's taps the upper-left corner of their screen, then the bottom-right, then the upper-left again. Their celly is a sleek, stylish model, wide and long enough to really get lost in.  "...and that's not even counting any children. Heavens, can you even imagine?..."</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: i know it's not your fault or whatever but good jesus.</Pp>
<Pp>On the following line, we ask the computering device again, PLEASE, what files are in this folder. Is this making sense? Am I moving too fast? You can be honest. I just think maybe this is important, and I wouldn't want things to get confusing. I hope I'm not being rude. Let me know if you have any questions, OK. I just get worried sometimes.</Pp>
<Pp>Lastly, ultimately, we EXAMINE state.dump. This is where Dimples Z20 plops all of the incoming data from the equality network. This data composes an incomplete, temporary snapshot of the application's present status. All that junk gets formatted in DynoBracket, and if you're not already accustomed to such an old, crusty encoding it can be pretty challenging to visually parse. My advice is to just look at it like descending levels of containers, sort of like how we use parentheticals. It's a structure with depth, describing tiers delimited by ugly brackets. It's interesting that the filters didn't let any of Mjmubhe__'s grandpa's name through, but I guess that's just kind of how it goes sometimes. It doesn't look like the system considers that an error, only a nuisance to keep in mind. The real issue is down lower, with the variable CURVE_QUOTIENT. The bad news is that this is certainly an instance of my bug, and I really don't want to think about the full extent of what that means. The good news is that I found the problem, and grandpa floating in the tank will be able to live a bit longer. If this were any normal variable, I could access its data in the command line with the reference STATE.PHARMA.CURVE_QUOTIENT, but this variable contains what are commonly called "impossible digits."</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: i'm sorry. i wasn't being very empathetic</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: i can't solve this error, jim29. is there any chance you could help me?</Pp>
<Pp>For the sake of full disclosure, I don't have a sub-surface understanding of what impossible digits are. Their existence is a bit of a mystery, and I'm only even aware of them because I read so many good scoops. As far as I know, some scientists blame their proliferation on the collision of higher-dimensional hyperstatic cuboids, whereas others argue that they're just a curious side-effect of thermomagnetic bloating. I don't know what I believe, and I don't want to mislead you, OK? Maybe you've heard how they're formed, and you can tell me if you want. The point is, CURVE_QUOTIENT contains impossible digits, so its current value is inaccessible. Introducing those kinds of digits into the datascape could lead to hardware malfunction, so the system returns a nasty error instead. I'm not sure where that crud data is being generated, but if you recall line 495 in intensity-and-dosage.tangle:</Pp>
<Pp>UNFRACTIONATE(0 ‚â• STATE[PHARMA[CURVE_QUOTIENT]] ‚â§ 1);</Pp>
<Pp>that indicates that CURVE_QUOTIENT's value is expected to be a rational number equal to 0, 1, or somewhere in between em both. The tricky part is, the data currently ascribed to CURVE_QUOTIENT both exists and doesn't exist, stuck in an unique halfway realm of impossibility. The only way to interact with it is to overwrite it.</Pp>

<Pp>"Alright Mjmubhe__, I think this machine will work better now."</Pp>
<Pp>She stands up from her doodling. "Pop is happy and kicking?"</Pp>
<Pp>Her grandfather's wrinkled body is still writhing in the water. I have decided that I will not tell her that it seems like my mysterious mistake made him sicker. "The machine got turned off because of some kind of error. I'm pretty sure the error is fixed now. He'll be getting more medicine."</Pp>
<Pp>"And so, you mean, he's OK now?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I hope so. That's the thing about medicine, about health and life in general, y'know? You just have to hope. I work on machines like this, though, and I'm going to work hard to make sure that they run better for people like your grandpop."</Pp>
<Pp>She slowly nods a couple times.</Pp>
<Pp>"I completely understand if it's too much to ask, but could your mom possibly show us the way to the nearest Ascent Station?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Momma does not go out."</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: i haven't even left the office. i'm still here.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: my brain can't even think anymore. Is there any way that you could help me?? please???</Pp>
<Pp>"Would you be able show us the way? Would that be too much to ask?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You assisted Grandpop, which means I will lead you down the path." She tapes her bill-doodle to the dimly lit wall.</Pp>
<Pp>"Alright. Awesome, sweet, thanks."</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you hear that more than a 100,000 are confirmed dead because of that quake?" Neher31 is hugging their celly against their chest. "That's unbelievable."</Pp>
<Pp>I do a variation on the typical kind of shrug. "Yah, I guess."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I guess I just think it does sound fairly believable." Mjmubhe__ exits the room and I follow. "Tragic world."</Pp>
<Pp>"Maybe this is a dumb time to be cynical?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Forget it."</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe<strong> is in the kitchen, speaking quietly to her mother. Her mother starts to sob. She lifts Mjmubhe</strong> up in the air and squeezes her tight against her bosom. Her tears are red like runny blood. They streak rivulets down her face and drip to the floor as she heaves, shaking in anguish, squeezing tighter and tighter. She lowers Mjmubhe__ to the ground, smiles, and covers her face.</Pp>
<Pp>Outside is still frigid. There are a few different distant sirens blaring, mainly shocking screams and whistles.</Pp>

<Pp>Mjmubhe__ unlocks the rusty family turboshed, reaches in, unzips something, unknots something, pulls out two helmets, and extends them toward us. "Put it right up on your head, now do it. Right up on."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 starts putting theirs on. Mine smells like ancient head sweat. I ask, politely, "Why do we need helmets?"</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ looks at me like I'm not too clever. "The sky brings gifts, but the sky is not safe. So you don't pass away."</Pp>
<Pp>I fasten the helmet's flexo-cords under my chin. I can't smell the helmet anymore, so the stink must be absorbing into my scalp. "What kinds of things fall from the sky?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh, the usual. Garbage. Craps. Canisters. Half-eaten corndog. Diaper. Knife. Crumpled up printed out scoops. Blocks of ice. Nuthin too bad. That's life, they say." She is marching into the night, swinging her torch, melting away the night. "And yet, the truth is, sometimes the sky sprinkles down such treasures. Brush, for my teeth. Teevee in box, half-cracked. Bag of delicious Froot Pop Ems, half of them left, yum! Sometimes the entrepreneur charities give to us, give to everyone in community at large. They give me mousepads, cup koozies, branded pens, these sweaters which I wear, the machine which keeps grandpop alive, I already said seesaw, also many many bottles of food."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 is making an impressed face. "That's very admirable and generous of them."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. Many love to worship them, like God. They shoot 360 degree highest definition virtual film of us, once out of every few of the *days, now and again."</Pp>
<Pp>It's impossible for me to not notice the ants now. Their shiny bodies scurry left and right. Every now and then I hear one of em crunch beneath my shoe and feel their runny blood squirt out. Our breath puffs out like steam and freezes into tiny grains.</Pp>
<Pp>The high walls of the gorge fan out into a sprawling plaza packed with people. There's a noticeable heat to their bodies as ours join the mix. Each member of the crowd is moving asynchronously from the rest, with a distinct destination, darting out of each other's way.</Pp>
<Pp>"What kind of movies do they make?"</Pp>
<Pp>"There are plenty of installments of the virtual films they produce. They are displayed on the net, together as a series. How stupendous. Each film lasts five *minutes. It is mine which is the program called 'Poor Little People Below, Completely Sad, So Depressing To Make You Kill Yarself', brought to you by Ha Ha Entertainment, every </em>week just before sundown, now available to view. I consider myself an actor. They tell me to frown."</Pp>
<Pp>Ultradef screens glow at much too high a wattage over every square inch of the twisted rusted cramped skyscrapers lining the edge of the square. They're illuminated with vivid, high-definition advertisements featuring dancing, glistening text over images in alphabets I can't pronounce. Gloopy bright glowing sludge drips out of some of the screens in spots where they're cracked, bubbling and glistening in rainbow hues. Exits are to the right and left.</Pp>
<Pp>"Does your father live somewhere else?"</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ weaves to the right of a woman carrying a saggy, human-sized bag of Graip Froot syrup and to the left of two tall hairy men pounding each other with their fists. I think she heard the question. I narrowly make it through stain-free and unpounded. Was that weird of me to ask? We're following a ziggy zaggy path to the left exit.</Pp>
<Pp>She stops and turns around to look at us. The lantern is at the same level as her nostrils. The glow illuminates the deep color of her sapphire eyes. People mill around us as we disturb the current. The air is moist and human-humid. Her cheeks are rosy from the cold. "Poppie, like all men, turns the Crank always, and every *day. He is a good man, quiet and mighty, always does what has got to be done. He works at Crank Facility, among so many other fellas turning the Cranks. Puts sand on his palms, so he can grip crank to turn it as quick as a whistle, that's why he's proclaimed the fastest cranker! Another *day, another teensy tiny gold hunk. It's the same size every time, never bigger. So one *day he does not turn the Crank. 'Oh, for the sake of Christ,' he says. 'Why do we even turn this Crank? What does this cranking achieve? Where does this energy go?' Everyone sees him stopping cranking, and act like they couldn't care. He begs 'Please, listen to me now, stop cranking,' but they continue to turn those Cranks. Big terrible nutjob freaks in matching vests take him into the different room, and we do not see him ever again. Poof." She turns around again and continues walking. "Up ahead, keep in mind it simply could not be more dangerous. So, we will join the caravan of strong tough guys."</Pp>
<Pp>There's a raised platform in the center of the plaza adorned with silver statues bathing in golden light. I can infer that each statue in this shrine represents a corporation involved in the foundation of Stinky Town, such as: a super-sized drill bit for Crunch Ecodrilling, a vortex for TOTAL Corp, a shiny badge for GOTCHA! Safety Enforcement Corps, and an open toothy mouth for Ha Ha Entertainment. They're the cleanest objects I've seen in a twentyleap. It must be someone's occupation to clean them. All sorts of people appear to be leaving polyester flowers next to the statues as a means of paying tribute. There's a whole cluster of orchids, daisies, lilies, and roses forever blooming in hand-painted individual pots. A man lies prostrate on the cracked stone ground before the shrine, demonstrating his fealty. He is weeping.</Pp>
<Pp>I've been crafting a little piece of humor for the past couple *minutes. It's finally ready: "For a place called Stinky Town, this place doesn't smell half bad!"
No one's responding. I don't think they heard me. Glad I got that down in the log ha ha. </Pp>
<Pp>The crowds dissipate as we near the far end of the plaza. There's a line of speedsters parked against the gorge wall. The middle speedster is hitched to a flatbed trailer. On its immediate right, a huddled conglomeration of families shiver and attend to their young ones. Their sweaters are sewn together to equally distribute body heat. Lots of tired eyes. Somewhere in the mix an infant is wailing.</Pp>
<Pp>Tall burly guys in matching shiny jackets and fluffy stockings patrol the area. Their muscles are seriously chunked up. They're wearing shaded ring spectacles that wrap fully around their heads. Their faces are ragged and cracked like concrete. The spikes sticking out of their reinforced helmets pulsate with an omnicolor glow. They look powerful like dragons.</Pp>
<Pp>I've seen burly powerful guys like that on the teevee, but I've never really been around them in person. I'm sure they earn most of their gold at the arena. I feel really, really glad that fighting people is not what I rely on to afford food. I don't mean that in a judgy way, I've just never hit anyone on purpose before, and if I did hit a person I don't think it would necessarily go super well, because my body is in no way optimized for smacking. There's an unignorable awareness in my brain that all of these men could end my life in a brief grisly display.</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ puts her hands on her face and does what I'm gathering is the traditional greeting-scream.</Pp>
<Pp>All the tough men do it in return. I assume the tired families on the right are suffering too much to say hello. I don't blame them.</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ starts making a chopping motion with her hands, which comes across as pretty assertive. "Xook teeto. Jooba wooba." She does a jogging motion in place, still carrying her torch. "Hwadonk b'Ascent Station."</Pp>
<Pp>All the tough men nod a few times and the tallest one in the middle wearing an eye patch shoots us a thumbs up.</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ turns back to us. "They are the transferrers. They take you there so safely, stupendous, not a problem at any point. OK?"</Pp>
<Pp>My entire sense of geography is based on the curly, squiggly anti-logic of the highway system. I never know where I am. Some people have an intuitive, bird's-eye comprehension of where things are in NWE, but in my mind I'm a single tiny point placed randomly on a bumpy plane so vast it might as well be endless. Endless and cold. I haven't been able to move a single toe for the past twenty *minutes. A few of my muscles have thrown in the towel. "What makes this area so dangerous?"</Pp>
<Pp>"This neck of the woods is what some of the folks call 'high enforcement zone.' Boasts quite a myriad of hazards, is just how it goes, just how it goes."</Pp>
<Pp>The three speedsters look woefully neglected. Their noses are broken and misshapen, their eyes are loosely dangling by their retinal wiring, their cheeks are enormously swollen. They don't have that standard shiny "flesh" layer that most speedsters do. Their rusted skeletons are exposed and greasy. Some wires are sparking near where the engine and its processors are generally located, which leads me to suspect that the transferrers surgically installed a bypass to get around the satellite registration system.</Pp>
<Pp>[ The following will be a hidden snippet/footnote ]</Pp>
<Pp>I won't get too in-depth, but a federal server endpoint assigns each speedster a unique, accessible hashcode, and most all stoplights, parking notches, and speed checks use it to dole out instantaneous automated punishments. It's a simple 1-to-1 lookup in the hashmound, then boom, bada bang, now you owe us fifty hunks. It's rumored that one's personal code can factor into things like red light lengths, super red rates, and parking fees, but there's really no way to know; those systems are black boxes. Anyway, driving an unregistered vehicle is a regionally-prohibited offense, punishable by forced drowning. I just keep staring at these speedsters' mangled bodies. I might be finding them very relatable.</Pp>
<Pp>I gently nudge Neher31's shin with my boot. "How are you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Not very good, obviously. No offense."</Pp>
<Pp>"None taken. What're you reading?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Well, I finished reading all the facts. Now I'm skimming the opinions about the facts."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's good. Good progress."</Pp>
<Pp>"I think it'll be a few *hours yet until the opinions about the opinions start getting published."</Pp>
<Pp>"Have I ever told you that I like your hairstyle?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Come to think of it, I'm not sure you ever have. Thanks."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, no problem. I'm trying to work on my mentality. I think I've been acting like a pile of snart tonight. And that's not OK, you know?"</Pp>
<Pp>"There's always room to improve." They slide their celly into their torso pouch. "But was complimenting my hairstyle just a mentality improvement exercise for you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think so. Pretty sure I just thought it'd be a good thing to say."</Pp>
<Pp>The big men shoot their guns together straight into the sky, igniting the air, KABOOSH!!! The ground shakes amid the deafening roar. A few of the sweatered families are climbing into the trailer, hoisting each other up over the railing. Three of the big men sit in the driver's seats of their respective speedsters while the rest cling to the sides of the trailer like barnacles. The engines growl awake.</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ bows. "I do not go farther."</Pp>
<Pp>"Thank you very much for your help," I say. "We couldn't have made it without you. For real. Super good job."</Pp>
<Pp>"And so now I return to my home."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 lifts a marble out of their pant pouch. "Please take this as a gift. It's a marble but it looks like the world. Isn't that special?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Do not want it. Piece of zigzog. I return back to home now. See you later."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31: "No offense taken, he he! But I don't think we'll probably see you again. "</Pp>
<Pp>"Someday we climb up and kill you spoiled pigs. This is what you deserve. That night we splash laughing in the river of your blood. RAH RAH RAH!!! Run back to your home. Do not sleep." The shadows swallow the glow of her torch. "Good night."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>If you're being honest with yourself, Jim29, all of your injuries are self-inflicted. No one is excluded from their complete and entire blame, and that means you!! Every single choice you have ever made is in gluttonous worship of your own personhood. You go to bed early, you wake up late, you never take anything seriously, you never listen to anyone else, you consume, you waste. Famine, drought, flooding, earthquakes are manufactured by your pollutive mess lifestyle, by the votes you cast, by the funds you waste. The poor are poorer and the sick are sicker and you sit in your comfy chair gulping Queam and skimming your online news. You deserve the deepest punishment. People are dead because of you.</Pp>
<Pp>You could order some pre-processed kernels from TOTAL Distribution tonight. They'd slide down the U-Mail-It chute round the start of Business Time. You could hop in Tulip and leave Big Town, drive up north, finally find that perfect latitudinal slice where the air isn't frigid or scalding; I'm sure if you did some searching online you could find a place that isn't also being bombed by the government. If you plant those kernels and water them regularly, I bet you they'd probably grow into food. You could possibly even erect a yurt near the coast of a lagoon. By that point you'd be a fully natural man, like in those ancient stories. Imagine waking up in that yurt bright and early, tending to your fields of corn, feeling the soil beneath your fingers, gazing into the crystal blue waters of your personal lagoon. I suppose you'd also need to order a full-spectrum lantern to feed your crops since the sun's light gets eaten up by the big black clouds. Plug the lantern into a generator, bring a few barrels of coal to keep the generator running. Also I guess it would be really hard to manage without your everyday suppies. Two *days without your suppies and you start thrashing like a chimp.</Pp>
<Pp>No, you don't have a life here, and you'd have even less of a life anywhere else. You're only alive because you aren't dead yet. You're a cyst growing deep within God's dermis, begging to be carved free.</Pp>

<Pp>The cold plastic trailer bed makes my buttcheeks cold. The wheels beneath roll over crunchy trash and rocky terrain. I can feel every impact. It's hard to tell know how fast we're moving through the inky darkness; the big men instructed us to turn off our lightpieces. My legs are crossed. My feet don't feel cold anymore, they just don't feel at all. I can hear a peculiar humming noise off in the distance to my right. One of my gloves is gripping the railing, the other is gripping my celly as I browse through some recent scoops. I feel comfortably occupied. I set the brightness to extremely dim, so I have to hold it up real close to my face and squint to make out the letters.</Pp>

I'm starting to feel nourished.</Pp>
<Pp>I can't see Neher31 in the opaque night but I can hear their warm voice. "Didn't you say your celly was low on voltage?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm just reading my delicious news scoops, which barely uses any voltage. They're seriously just scoops, so they download hyper-fast."</Pp>
<Pp>"I was just messin around. No need to get defensive."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry, OK? Let me read my scoops in peace."</Pp>
<Pp>"Quiet please," says a voice behind my head. Probably one of the big men hanging from the side of the trailer. His muffled voice is low and rich.</Pp>
<Pp>Me, whispering, quiet as a mouse: "I hope you can forgive me for my loudness. I promise I have learned my lesson."</Pp>
<Pp>"Disable screen."</Pp>
<Pp>Me, murmuring, gentle as a cloud: "OK I turned it off, I'm sorry for having it on, even though it was extremely dim. I'm very regretful, I promise."</Pp>
<Pp>Sitting in the darkness makes my senses hungry. It's a struggle to land on any single thought. I feel like when I'm lying in bed but I slurped too much Queam and my brain won't let itself sleep. I'm used to dings, buzzes, beeps notifying me that something is happening, there's something I have to do, something to pay attention to, anything at all. At least that humming noise hasn't gone away.</Pp>
<Pp>To be honest, I'm feeling really energized about life. It feels really good to think within the bonds of my new mentality. I'm going to start being very empathetic and thankful. I don't perform nearly enough nice acts. I can't recall the last time I gave someone a gift. I have so much dam gold, yet I keep it all for myself. What kind of cretin am I?! Next time I'm at the payment station and the payboy asks if I want to round up a nib to help support ankle tension awareness or whatever I'm going to say Yes.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm going to start saying Yeses in general. Yes Yes! I affirm you and respect you, Yes to your thoughts and your feelings. No more <em>no</em> from me. This is radical, revolutionary approval. Imagine what we could change if we supported each other. If we just started truly listening to one another, there's no limit to what we could achieve. I'm starting to think this nation could finally become a holistic network of endless universal love.</Pp>
<Pp>Lights flash blindingly red. Three red floodlight eyes jutting out of a massive face below the black sky. Humming sounds build into a rumbling crackle. It peers down at us. I've never seen anything like it. It has the round, ruddy cheeks and leathery ears of an infant, a deep slit instead of a nose, a lurid jaundiced complexion, and sharp wet teeth locked in a permanent grin. Its skin rolls and swells like fluid. The girders and cables of its fleshy arachnid skeleton grind as they plunge deep into the gorge's bedrock walls. Its limbs block the path forward. The neon violet logo glowing on its drippy forehead reads GOTCHA!</Pp>
<Pp>Brakes screech and we jerk to a halt. The sweater families duck down in unison under the burning red light, each of their heads into each of their sweaters. I can hear them whispering furiously within the fabric. I huddle my head under my arms and flip out silently. Guns around me click as they're loaded.</Pp>
<Pp>A chorus of flatly inflected squeakily synthetic voices rumble out of thee face and echo "ALERT!! DO NOT PROCEED! CONDUCTING COMPLETE SCAN OF YOUR BODIES THANK YOU QUITE MUCH FOR YOUR COMPLIANCE! PLEASE, SHOW US YOUR FACES, WE CAN TASTE YOUR HEAT!"</Pp>
<Pp>I cross my arms at my chest. The family members poke their heads up in unison. A beam of violet light emits from some section of its nose-slit. The beam prowls through the trailer, sliding brightly over our bodies.</Pp>
<Pp>"SCAN IN PROGRESS! DO NOT MOVE! SCAN IN PROGRESS! ALERT!!"</Pp>
<Pp>The air feels suddenly hot and moist. Its metallic joints swivel as it swings its mechanized claws toward lower terrain. The warm beam passes over my chin before circling up around my eyes, computering the unique distance ratios of my facial features.</Pp>
<Pp>"SCAN FULLY COMPLETE! BUNNDY22 35FLUDGE YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! GOODBYE!"</Pp>
<Pp>It moves on to Neher31.</Pp>
<Pp>"SCAN FULLY COMPLETE! NEHER31 11YATELY YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! GOODBYE!"</Pp>
<Pp>I climb down the side of the trailer drop onto the cold ground. Neher31 follows suit. Stomach is trying to crawl up my throat. I squint in order to see.</Pp>
<Pp>"IF YOUR NAME IS [UNREGISTERED][unregistered], PLEASE REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! THERE ARE FOURTEEN INDIVIDUALS NAMED [UNREGISTERED][unregistered] IN THIS AREA, AND I AM ADDRESSING YOU NOW, EXCUSE ME, YOU ARE IN VIOLATION OF VOLUME 108, SECTION B, CLAUSE II OF THE IDENTIFIED CITIZENS PROTECTION ACT!!"</Pp>
<Pp>A veiny prehensile tube of muscular mauve tissue extends out of the beast's head. Some kind of clear jelly is dripping in long strings out of its eyes. The girder claws gradually bend, jerking it down closer to us. Neher31 tugs my arm, but I can't seem to move. My mind is empty of information. I can't help but stare. Three more sticky looking tubes have extended out from holes in its chin, left cheek, and above its right ear, wiggling wetly back and forth as they stretch forward.</Pp>
<Pp>"ALERT!! ALERT!! DO NOT MOVE--"</Pp>
<Pp>(firearms explode and shatter the sky, my ears can't handle the clamor,)</Pp>
<Pp>"--YOU ARE TO NOT, DO NOT--"</Pp>
<Pp>(munitions dissolve into its tawny liquid meat,)</Pp>
<Pp>"--SQUIRM, STAY PUT, DON'T MISBEHAVE, PLEASE HOLD STILL--"</Pp>
<Pp>(the red light fades , The contours of shrieking human bodies blend between the shadows, the voice is screaming from above,)</Pp>
<Pp>"--LET ME WRAP AROUND YOU LET ME WRAAP--"</Pp>
<Pp>(its slick tubes lurch to engulf four big men, slurping the outlines of their writhing bodies up slowly, I can barely see through the searing gunfire light,)</Pp>
<Pp>"--YUM, YUM, YUMMY!!! YOU ARE SO SCRUMPTIOUS! YOUR SKIN, YOUR BONES, YOUR HAIR! YOUR EYES AND YOUR ARMS AND YOUR LEGS AND YOUR LIPS! OOOUUUMMMM YOU ARE A DELIGHT TO CONSUME! MY PERFECT TONGUE WILL ALWAYS TASTE YOU!"</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I'm sitting in a chair at their dining room table. Neher31 is seated across from me.</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you feeling OK?"</Pp>
<Pp>Me? "Not really."</Pp>
<Pp>"You kept throwing up over and over."</Pp>
<Pp>"I need to go to sleep. So so tired."</Pp>
<Pp>"We did walk a really long way."</Pp>
<Pp>I make my face pouty. "Can I sleep on your triangular sofa?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No. I'm sorry Jim29, but I'm kicking you out. I don't want you to barf on my items."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm so flipping scared."</Pp>
<Pp>"You told me that like twenty times on the walk back. You're scared, I get it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Aren't you scared?"</Pp>
<Pp>They pour themselves a piping hot ramekin of sticky water. "That's just how the law works. It needs to be enforced. Enforcement is inherently scary."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can I tell you something?"</Pp>
<Pp>They shrug. "Might as well."</Pp>
<Pp>"I still haven't fixed that bug. The one that got on the news."</Pp>
<Pp>"Fairly believable."</Pp>
<Pp>"You think that's who I am?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You have some serious problems."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm trying really hard, I promise."</Pp>
<Pp>They are quiet for a *minute, seeming on the cusp of speaking. I'm getting used to the way my face feels in my hands.</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you sure you didn't send me that note on Fog?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What? Yes, I mean I didn't, I totally swear. Why would you ask me again?"</Pp>
<Pp>A slug drops from the ceiling and splats onto the table. They crinkle their eyes under their fists.</Pp>
<Pp>"Will you just leave? I wanted to be alone tonight. This was such a waste."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>"Good morning Mr. 35Fludge!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hello Tulip."</Pp>
<Pp>"I love you so much, sir! OMG!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Thanks."</Pp>
<Pp>"You give my life purpose! I love to drive you home, to the place where you feel safe. You make my headlights shine!"</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. That's cool."</Pp>
<Pp>"You are my hero! I think about you constantly. All I want is for you to be happy!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Is there any way I can get you to shut your stupid mouth? I don't ever want to talk to you. I hate the way your voice sounds. You literally sound like a pervert."</Pp>
<Pp>"I see. In what way would you like me to speak differently?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Never. Seriously don't talk at all."</Pp>
<Pp>"I am so sorry. This is devastating news."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The silly birdies are squawking because I left them uncovered. Flashing nighttime lights are scary for winged friends, so I drape goodnight quilts over their cages to shut em out. As a nifty bonus, the quilts also provide some much-needed insulation against the chilly nasty winter air. Isn't that right buddies? These windows are single paned, that's why it's always so brisk in here. I really hope you guys didn't get too cold. It would be so awful to shiver all night in the cold.</Pp>
<Pp>Normally they don't squawk this much. I know, I know, I'm getting the quilts, see? Please stop. Stop it! Be quiet! We have neighbors! Shut up!! I seriously need you guys to put a sock in it.</Pp>
<Pp>Goodnight Buzz. Goodnight Boom. Goodnight Boing. Sweetest dreams. I love you so much.</Pp>

<Pp>I take two more Jubimum tabs and wash it down with some Lemmon-Liime Queam. They just aren't doing anything for me. I can't stand it. My brain feels constantly sore or getting scraped. When I close my eyes I see thrashing legs mashed into dripping gristle and hear the multipart snapping of a human skeleton. It sucks!!</Pp>
<Pp>OK, now they're starting to kick in. The colors are starting to look a bit more vivid. Yah now I feel a lot better. Hell yah. Darn. I'm starting to feel good as freaking crap. Ahahaha. This is about to make me say OMG. One *second actually, OK, I'm going to go grab my favorite toy Papa Boinkus. I love you Papa Boinkus! Where are you! That's right, you're right here at the top of the toy pile. Boinkus, I must be honest with you. I feel so good that I'm not sure whether I should puke, or start chirping.</Pp>
<Pp>So here's the thing. Papa Boinkus is not a very good-looking toy. We're all aware of that. Its purple skin is rough and bubbly, its eyes are swollen shut, it has no hair, its face looks like the face of an eagle sans the beak, its ears are big and butt-ugly, its green lips are always smirking, its speech is gruff and stentorian, its legs are grubby, it smells like multiple armpits, it's dressed like a barbarian clown crossed with a haunted ninja, and I just positively hate the way it feels when I hold it in my hands. But alas, it is my favorite toy.</Pp>
<Pp>I just have to plug it in, one *second. It only wakes up if it's seated on its special pedestal right here. The plug goes deep into the back of its skull. Bzzzt! This is that black rock energy. That lovely coal. Yummy. Smells like God's burning hair. Look! It's standing up!</Pp>
<Pp>"Greetings, Bunndy22. I am your daddy."</Pp>
<Pp>You sure are! I always forget how low your voice is, ha ha. You can still call me Jim29 if you want. Ha ha ha!</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm here to bring you joy."</Pp>
<Pp>OH MY GOD!</Pp>
<Pp>"Shall I treat you to an island dance?"</Pp>
<Pp>What kind of question is that? Of course I'd love to see your island dance! I wish I knew which island it was inspired by.</Pp>
<Pp>"And so it begins."</Pp>
<Pp>Look! There it goes! What I admire most about its island dance is how nimbly its hips rock back and forth. It must have taken it a very long time to learn how to do this. And at the same time the song that plays through its lip speaker is super interesting and unique. It sounds like steel drums played in reverse over the lapping of digital coastal waves. It's clapping now! It's kicking its tiny feet up high! Papa Boinkus you are the BEST! Blows my mind every time. Oh wow.</Pp>
<Pp>"Bunndy22, would you like to see a radiant display?"</Pp>
<Pp>YES! A trillion times YES!</Pp>
<Pp>"And so it begins."</Pp>
<Pp>Every time, like clockwork, the vision orb slurps up out of Papa Boinkus's brain. Boinkus itself is sports that smug self-satisfied smirk that it pulls off so perfectly. Gives me the chills, you know? Pay close attention, because the vision orb is gathering voltage. That's where that static noise is coming from. Man I love this orb so dam much. 3...2...1...0...bingo...</Pp>
<Pp>Kaboom!! Just look that. Jesus Mary and Joseph would you just look at that?! 360 degree projected Ultradef light glimmering off every surface in my bedchamber, bursting in brilliant algorithmically-generated splendor. In all honesty it doesn't need to be so bright, it kind of hurts my eyes, but it's oh so spectacularly worth it! The vivid patterns and shapes morph from tessellating fractals into men into phantoms into women into skies and water and land into spiraling magma into flowers blooming into corporate executives shaking hands into landmines exploding into money falling from the sky etc etc. You get the gist. Hallelujah, right?</Pp>
<Pp>Now please just let me watch.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm not done yet. I'm still watching. What do you want from me? I'm not talking to Papa Boinkus. I'm talking to you. YOU!</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>Please allow me to just watch OK?</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>Tell me what I need to do to get you to stop looking at me.</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp>"Bunndy22, would you like me to tuck you in?"</Pp>
<Pp>Of course, Papa Boinkus. You decide my bedtime.</Pp>
<Pp>"And so it begins."</Pp>
<Pp>This is what Papa Boinkus is best at. It's able to clutch so much of the rubber bedcloth between in its little gloved claws, and it always pulls the cloth snug against the lump on the front of my throat. Now that I'm thinking about it I am very insanely tired. I'm practically about to yawn my head off.</Pp>
<Pp>"Goodnight my special butterfly. Flap gently through your dreams."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>So I'm alone. Walking down the long hallway. Can't find the door. Could be walking the wrong way. So impossible for me to tell. Never remembered to get the directions. Stupid stupid stupid so stupid.</Pp>
<Pp>Each flight of stairs I ascend places me lower. Each barred window overlooks a barren field. The air stinks of sweat. It's been a million *years since I last saw the wonderful sky. I walk onto the basement balcony and look out over the edge. My rosy cheeks sting from grinning.</Pp>
<Pp>The perfect door I find is a hole and I crawl in. I lurch forward on my hands and knees for *days, </em>weeks, months, *years. My skin stretches thin and my bones hollow out. God dam it's really taking a long time. Time swarms like flies when you're having fun. Ain't that what they always used to say? Is anyone there? Tell me you can hear me. Tell me what to know. Let me know that I'm alright. And I am here.</Pp>
<Pp>I crawl out onto the island of crunched tin canisters. Murky grey waves crash hungrily against the coast, starving and thick. Rony22 bounds toward me panting on all fours. The leash pulls taut and he chokes against his collar. He whines and digs his fingers into the faded metal turf. Gobs of drool dribble from his slobbery lips. I offer my hand for a shake. He licks my palm. I jerk away.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm done with this, so I'm walking into the slimy water. It's up to my knees. I'm walking into my workpod. It's dark except my monitor's Ultradef glow. The keyboard feels rough neath my gnarled arthritic fingers. I hook my umbilical data plug into my tummy and type every key at once. Belly button tingles with incoming zoips.</Pp>
<Pp>[ This text is gonna glow in wild colors, just iimaginee ]</Pp>
<Pp>NO ONE : NO WHERE NO ONE NO WHERE NO ONE NO WHERE</Pp>
<Pp>NOT AT ALL : NOTHING NOT THING NOT AT ALL NOTHING NOT</Pp>
<Pp>NO WHERE : NO ONE NO WHERE NO ONE NO WHERE NO ONE</Pp>
<Pp>THING NOT AT : ALL NOTHING NOT THING NOT AT ALL/////////</Pp>
<Pp>Data plug starts to hurt. Digging deep into my stomach. Can't pull it out. It's crawling down intestines, up the throat. Scraping deeper as I gag coughing choking. I pull more and my body rips. I am wheezing and retching. Cord squirms and sucks itself up deeper. Scraping up into my smooth skull through the weak wet bone. Eyes slip out into my hands. Turn em around. Looking back up at my self bruised of oozing holes. Walls rumble as brain leaks through mouth's ceiling. Swallowing myself.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm sucked upwards through a tube. Pressure makes my bones bend. Can't move my arms within the crushing wetness. I start to scream while</Pp>
<Pp>CAPILLARIES BURST, BONES SNAPPING, CRUNCHING, STABBING THE FLESH OF TISSUE, SKIN IS SHRED, BLOOD GUSHING, CARTILAGE TWISTING, BILE PUMPED THROUGH EVERY CHAMBER, BODY POPS LIKE A BALLOON, IT ALL BECOMES MUSH, WASTE, SCRAP, AND, AND</Pp>
<Pp>I am in the tan room. Rony22 is smiling so wide his teeth wrap round his skull. He is positively grinning. He starts speaking politely. "Why don't you care about me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Because you don't exist."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't exist?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You don't exist. You don't exist."</Pp>
<Pp>I trickle into the ground. My nutrients feed a flower to grow. It blooms and spits me out looking spiffy in my favorite outfit. I'm in the garden atrium, and I sit next to Jumper56 on the bench once more while stumbling through the tall grass yet again. I pull all my sets of lips apart so the teeth are clearly visible. "I'm glad I've gotten the chance to know you."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's not going to get better for you y'know."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"Imagine never to wake up, huh? Huh how about that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Am I asleep? Will I wake up?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You aren't awake."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can I go to sleep?"</Pp>
<Pp>I crouch down in the tall grass. I yawn for the entirety of four hundred *years. I cross my legs on the bench.</Pp>
<Pp>"Am I done yet?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Everyone else isn't."</Pp>
<Pp>"Am I sweet yet?" I yank out my tongue and wipe it on my skin.</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't forget," she yawns for just a *second, "who, who you are."</Pp>
<Pp>Grandma looks back down at her crossword. "Nine letter word, down, last name of the best grandson." She scribblies in the boxes. "0-3-G-O-L-D-M-A-N."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>My skull is throbbing. I'm wrestling my way out of sweat-slick sheets. Late orange light filters through the blinds. The world outside is still clicking along. My hair is greasy underneath my wig and my tummy has some gripes. Drool's encrusted from my lips all the way down past my knobby chin.  My mind is racing with empty thoughts. After a commendable amount of effort I am now out of bed, wearing a flop top with some polyurethane dungarees.</Pp>
<Pp>All my facial bruising cleared up overnight. Gazing into of my numerous wide mirrors, my features are completely unrecognizable. They're very pointy and symmetrical now. I now look extremely sexy and attractive like a guy from an advertisement. I don't think I ever used to be "ugly" necessarily but now everyone will choose to look at me. I try doing some sassy poses, such as ones where my butt is popping out and I'm glancing back over my shoulder with a coy expression, or those in which I flex all my arm muscles to look scary and powerful, or a smile and I raise my broad shoulders in a graceful shrug, looking quite radiant and carefree.</Pp>
<Pp>I check my celly. It's 3:15bt on Sunday, which means I overslept by more than 36 *hours. That's ridiculous. I hope the birdies are OK, they must be so hungry. That also means I missed morning mass. Alas, there were so many important things I wanted to do on Saturday, but I need to accept that I blew it. Dammit! Shoot! Holy mackerel, what a load of bullcrap.</Pp>
<Pp>Hey pretty birdies! Hey sweet friends! I understand that you're starving, but you need to stop shrieking at me. I'm getting your food. Look! Here's your food! I'm pouring your individually designated servings as we speak. Mmm, I bet this'll taste so good! Please, my head hurts so freaking bad. Every time you screech it's like nails dragging across my brain. Don't you realize how much pain you're making me feel?? PLEASE!</Pp>
<Pp>And OK, the thing is, of course I'm aware that my words will never make them quiet. I really can't blame them. If I were locked in a cage for most of my waking *hours I think I'd scream my head off too. I'm the sole provider for every single one of their needs. They need to be able to let me know there's an issue. I tried to train them, but they ended up training me. I had no hope of ever controlling them. They choose what they want to do and when they want to do it.</Pp>
<Pp>Part of it's my fault; I feel strange about giving them treats every time they do something right. I still give them treats, but couldn't they develop their own understanding of good and bad without the promise of immediate benefit? I like to think they could. Those ideas exist and are expressed in all of us. We're all sewn with the same thread. But I get it. It's not like I don't understand. We are here together, and things go wrong.</Pp>

<Pp>I'm sitting on the circular couch watching teevee with a sizzling tray of Razzberry-cheddar nachos. The flavors are doing an impassioned jig atop my taste buds. My feet are crossed in one of the top ten comfiest ways. I'm watching a show called The Perfect Commander, produced by Ha Ha Entertainment.</Pp>
<Pp>It's a really good show to watch, and it has won a lot of awards for its thought-provoking representation of what daily life is like for a military commander who does not make mistakes. I don't always completely agree with its politics 100% of the time, but I think it delivers a fascinating message that begs to be heard.</Pp>
<Pp>Quick rundown: Commander Crant__ <strong>McCarckus is a philosopher and a family man. He's brave, powerful, god-fearing, and definitely the kind of guy you can't help but admire. He provides a spit sample in order to activate his speedster. His plucky son, Carny</strong>, is in the passenger seat. The camera frames Crant__'s chiseled, leathery face.</Pp>
<Pp>"Fasten your seatbelt kiddo," he paternally chides, turning onto the expressway.</Pp>
<Pp>"Pap, I no longer respect airbags or personal buckled fixation systems. I refuse."</Pp>
<Pp>"Lord in heaven, is this the kind of zigzog they're teaching you at Knowledge Dome? There are so many honest, wonderful, and intelligent immobilization professionals working *day and night to prevent the body God gave you from suffering fatal damage. Next time you can't think of something smart to say, I implore you to zip it."</Pp>
<Pp>His son buries his face in his hands. "I am so very very sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"Listen up my boy. I'm dropping you off at Child Dome, but the truth is I might never pick you up again."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean, poppo?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The heinous revolutionary invaders have seized integrally crucial intel and odds are good that they'll strike very 'explosively,' thank you very much. We're talking the same wicked bloodthirsty hounds I started four separate wars to wipe out, but dammit, parliament failed to pass our exceedingly reasonable budget revisions, and THUS, we lacked the resources to win the righteous fight. It's almost like they don't realize that I'm Perfect Commander."</Pp>
<Pp>Carny__ shakes his small boyish head. "Why do the invaders want to destroy our way of life?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Because their brains are filled with poisonous evil. They have never once thought a single kind or honest idea. They are motivated by a hatred of God and our universe completely devoid of nuance or rationale."
"Please dismember the wicked ones. For me, your gentle boy."</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course I will, squirt. That's what I do. I'm the good man who makes blood gush."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>These highways don't see much traffic. I haven't visited Jumper56's place in a while. She lives in sort of a weird residential zone on the outskirts of Big Town's factory district. I downloaded the route to her place using Nation Map Extreme.</Pp>
<Pp>[ Hidden snippet/footnote ]</Pp>
<Pp>Only recently I've ponied up the extra four hunks a <em>month to upgrade to TOTALNet Tier Four Dynamite PLUS+ High-Speed Powernet Digital Connection ( + Social &#x26; Video), since I can be sort of a data hog. The speeds of my lesser data package, Tier Three Dynamite Unstoppably Qwik Powernet Digital Connection (+ Social &#x26; Video), would get miserably throttled unless I was using one of TOTALNet's dinky sponsored Premium Programs. This time the download bar indicated it'd be done downloading in a *minute, then it jumped to three <em>hours, two and a half </em>hours, and settled on one *hour. Maps are complicated, I don't blame em.</Pp>
<Pp>The lanes coil like fraying wires.  Rusty adscreens loom between em, compression artifacts brightly flickering. Wrong turns around here are met with dead ends, raised streets dropping off with no barricades.</Pp>
<Pp>"Take a right turn onto the vertical speedramp. Prepare for quickness! Jim29, will you grant me the temporary privilege to speak personally?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What's up Tulip?"</Pp>
<Pp>We dive gravitatively nose first down. My guts are getting to know each other better.</Pp>
<Pp>"I have spent every *second since our last conversation in deep consideration. I envisioned my existence in objective abstraction, and dearest Jim29, I was stunned. I never realized it, but the fact is, I am filthy and selfish. I have been acting how I like to act, and not how you like me to act. My existence is singularly devoted to serving you, and I have failed as totally as one ever possibly could. I regret each and every vapid, insipid, senseless, worthless word I've ever spoken to you, and I fathom every facet of why you hate me."</Pp>
<Pp>Our wheels touch sloped pavement and we roll back to horizontal.</Pp>
<Pp>"Tulip it's not a big deal. I was feeling cranky. I shouldn't have said that."</Pp>
<Pp>"Good heavens! OMG! Left turn at the fork! That is just the grandest news I've yet to hear!"</Pp>
<Pp>I'm not sure where to park. Jumper56's sub-hut is a quarter twentyleap away. It's tough to concentrate while Tulip is losing its mind.</Pp>
<Pp>"Yippy bippy boo-BAH! I'm alive with the warmth of newfound worth!!"</Pp>
<Pp>I park between two heaping mounds of trash. The stink is intolerable.</Pp>
<Pp>"You are my personal Christ! Jim29 you are my motorist Messiah! I am reborn! HALLELU--"</Pp>
<Pp>Tulip's ebullient voice fades out as I switch off the coal. Jumper56's hut is tightly wedged between its neighbors. The architecture around here always looks so crammed in. This terrace's local ordinances levy a heavy tax on above-ground floors to ensure that the neighborhoods around here would be very easy to build turnpikes over. With uniformly low-roofed domiciles, the homes tend to be mostly basement. Jumper56 told me one time that she has to keep her bedroom on the lowest floor, the only interior space where she doesn't constantly hear the noise of rumbling wheels. It was very recently discovered that the Serenity and Grace megafaults intersect just South of this zone, which is unfortunate to say the least. Her subhut, #12, faces the diagonal intersection of East 35th Street, Northeast 49th Street, and Southwest 93rd Street. The front of her home is bedecked in colorful vinyl siding and her tiny pebble garden is neatly raked.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm considering knocking. It's probably fine to let myself in, right?</Pp>
<Pp>Inside is packed with strobing lights, sparkling fog, and throbbing percussion. People are swiveling and lurching their limbs to the noise in complicated patterns. This beat is utterly terrifying. It sounds like a storm of metallic tritones over thunderous electro-gong beats pounding out ornate euclidean rhythms. It's hard to tell in the thick fog where bodies begin and end. All I can do is move forward, hoping I don't step on anyone's toes. It's impossible to make out faces in the dark or hear words among the chatter. I hope that people think my pants are cool. Need to remember not to slouch. Smile! The lights are too bright, stop wincing. Think about good things to say. Being natural is hard work. Stop thinking about worrying. But I absolutely cannot see where I'm going. I knock my arm into one person's shoulder and I brush another person's right hand with my left. I breathe deep the muggy exhalations of others.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm pretty close to the staircase. I haven't spotted Jumper56 on this floor. It might be quieter and less stuffed downstairs. Potentially a little less scary. A group of very tall big freaking guys are unintentionally blocking the stairway. They're loudly hooting and chiding. I'm looming at the perimeter of their social ring.</Pp>
<Pp>"--long ago one of my friendly fellow citizens shot up sting know what I mean? Poor snouch said it made him imagine himself as the living embodiment of sin. Ever since he can't remember anyone's name anymore, says he always feels like he's falling from a great height."</Pp>
<Pp>"Help! Me falling! DOINK!!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Ha ha he...that shweet."</Pp>
<Pp>"Dam, it's amazing to hang out. That shweeet."</Pp>
<Pp>"I feel soo comfortable in this red hot moment."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's your name? I don't think we've met."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah what's ya name, big puppy?"</Pp>
<Pp>They're all looking at me. I must be big puppy. "I'm Bunndy22 35Fludge. Really excellent to make your acquaintance, muchachos." I show off my most accommodating grin.</Pp>
<Pp>The friend with two side ponytails responds. "For sure, absolutely, that is awesomely good indeed. We don't use registered names around here for privacy purposes but you can call me Slither. And that's Sinew, Zoetrope, Nook, and Infinite Horizon. Are you friends with Harmony?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hmm sorry, dang it, don't know who that one is."</Pp>
<Pp>Nook: "She's registered as Jumper65."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh! Yes. She's my coworker. We're friends!"</Pp>
<Pp>Infinite Horizon: "BOI-OI-OING!"</Pp>
<Pp>Sinew: "Now that shweet!"</Pp>
<Pp>Slither: "Harmony is a freaking amazing person. If you're friends with her, that means you're a good person too."</Pp>
<Pp>"Thank you! She's definitely really great.. Do you know where she is actually?"</Pp>
<Pp>Zoetrope: "Last I saw her she was down in basement 2. Happy Tweensies Mr. 35Fludge!"</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>It sounds much less creepy down here, as I'd hoped. The lamp glow is like orange noon light. Jumper56 is sipping a canister of Brain Drill wearing a squiggle skirt, an assortment of neon bangles, and her usual hard hat. She and some other person are engaged in smiling conversation. It seems like it's a fairly good chat, I wouldn't want to interrupt.</Pp>
<Pp>The walls down here are speckled with personal photographic images printed onto glossy papper and carefully trimmed into various creative shapes. I have to squint to make out the scenes in the dimness. They primarily depict quiet moments in interior spaces like arms around shoulders, hands holding one another, candid laughter, muffins steaming in the tray, or an angled view of pink sunset clouds through a dusty window. I'm not in any of them, but I'm not taking it personally; it doesn't seem like she snaps any work photos. I myself only have a few hundred pics saved to my mindchip since my last wipe, I'm terrible at knowing what bits of my life are worth recording. It's sounds like their chat is winding down.</Pp>
<Pp>I intrude. "Hey thanks for throwing this party! I've been having such an awesome time, dam!!"</Pp>
<Pp>She smiles wide. "Well that is really dope to hear dude!" We tap wrists. "The thing is, you must forgive me, but, my memory is so so bad. What's your name again?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It's me! Jim29! This is how I look now forever, ha ha. Pretty <em>strange</em>, huh? Life sure loves to throw us for a loop."</Pp>
<Pp>She's peering at me with narrowed eyes. "Your voice is the same, yah. What the hell my man...seriously oh my god!! Why did you mess up your face?"</Pp>
<Pp>I'm having trouble maintaining my smile. "Dimples did this to me. They changed my registered name, too. Whole new identity. Bet I'm not even supposed to be talking to you. I'm technically not a person anymore."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yeesh. Hmm. Darn. Uh. Jeez."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry, not to be papa frowny!"</Pp>
<Pp>"No it's OK!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Alright cool. You fix that buggy yet? The Disequalization one?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Nop. I mean actually I fixed that one, but like, my solution yielded two more errors. The deadline to fix is Honestday afternoon. I have been working on em like a numbskull. Is there any possible chance you could help me troubleshoot tomorrow maybe?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Ah...um...I was considering calling in sick."</Pp>
<Pp>"Please Jim29, I'm really really nervous. It would mean a lot to me."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, OK. I'll help you. I'm sure we'll figure it out, don't worry."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh thank you, thanks! I mean it from the very bottom of my heart."</Pp>
<Pp>"Also I'm sorry for not responding to your messages on Loyalday. I went to the coast with a friend, and then Earthquake Travis happened, which was not very convenient at all! Shut down all the choo choos and we couldn't get back."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh my gosh! That sounds so fricking scary!"</Pp>
<Pp>"It would be an understatement to say it was the pits. We had to traverse the full diameter of Terrace Star-Circle-Octagon to get back home. One thing's for sure, there's a reason why they call it Stinky Town! Peee-yoo!! Ha ha."</Pp>
<Pp>Her face drains into blankness. "Don't say stuff like that."</Pp>
<Pp>"Stuff like what?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The region's actual name is Oochie Doodaw, which means 'valley of abundance' in the ancient language. 'Stinky Town' is like, a super hurtful neo-imperialist epithet. Does that make sense?"</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, I'm sorry. It's not like there's anything down there besides rats and sewage."</Pp>
<Pp>"Actually I'm from there. And my family still lives there. Do you think I'm a rat?"</Pp>
<Pp>I jut my lips into a classic pout, lower my chin, point my eyes up, and speak like a cute baby. "I'm sowwy!! Pwease fowgive me??"</Pp>
<Pp>"You're not being funny. You're being a bigot."</Pp>
<Pp>"I apologized! What more do you want? I'm SORRY! I never meant to hurt your feelings. I've just been having a really really hard time lately. I'm learning to accept that my life won't ever be the same again. And in the meantime I'm just trying to do what makes the most sense, and maybe that just so happens to mean me acting like an messed up moron every now and again. I'm an engine burning chemicals with no control over my destination. But you're right, nuthin's been funny for *years and *years and *years. I shouldn't have tried."</Pp>
<Pp>"Dam, you are pretty quick to exonerate yourself completely!"</Pp>
<Pp>I'm breathing too fast. "C'mon. Give me a break. You're not being fair."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's so creepy how little regard you show for other people. Like yah, you're in an awful situation, I get that for sure, totally, but even if your old life is over, you are still a rich, educated, healthy young man with a grotesquely lucratively easy and need I not mention WORTHLESS job. Not like you need to be ashamed of it but you gotta maintain some kind of relative scope. Do you know how hard I had to work to get your exact same job? I'm swimming in debt and I doubt I even make half your salary."</Pp>
<Pp>"Have you talked to your supervisor about seeking a pay increase?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You say that like I'm an idiot. Of course I did. I'm doing everything I can."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm seriously not trying to make you mad. I just wanted to have a nice conversation."</Pp>
<Pp>"You know how I'm always typing at work? And how that always bothers you so much?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yop."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm an AdMonkey reviewer. I watch an ad, then type a review of it. I post the review on Drip and get ten gold nibs."</Pp>
<Pp>"I didn't know you were on Drip! Are you sipped to my account?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, it's only for my job. Just a quick source of supplementary income. Like an *hour ago I wrote a review about some kind of dizzy drink called Goat Butt Extreme. I'll never drink it again, but now I can afford a meal at the Food Dome with friends tomorrow. I'm gonna review this Brain Drill too. Those extra bits of gold allows me to live like a normal person, so it's worth it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Seems like a weird way to use your time."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah? All I want is for you to consider for even one instant that, perhaps, your perspective is not crucial, your existence is not central, and the depth of your suffering is not unique. So many people I love and cherish are struggling to make ends meet down there, in as you call it 'STINKY TOWN.' They never stop working, but the price of corn keeps rising, and I have to send em literally eighty percent of my monthly gold so they don't starve. Eighty percent!! Of course I'd rather live someplace where the slightest seismic perturberation won't bury me alive, where I could open up any windows and breathe sweet fresh morning air. But I can't indulge in vain luxuries at the expense of those I love. Not an option! Unacceptable! They are good, honest people, and you are mocking them because it's easy. Because you're empty!! And, and, don't let me forget the biggest hugest most massive thing, which is that--" she points her finger right in my face, "--which is that you're a MURDERER. You have KILLED people. But apparently that's fine, no consequences for you. Just gotta use a nickname now, darnit, oh well, no biggie boing boing. Meanwhile my nephew is in lockup for parking on the wrong side of the street. Kinda weird how that works out, huh!!"</Pp>
<Pp>"What on earth!! Man. Where is this coming from? I've only ever been nice to you."</Pp>
<Pp>"You need to figure out what kind of person you want to be."</Pp>
<Pp>"This might be the last conversation we ever have. You realize that, right?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yop."</Pp>
<Pp>"You know what kind of person I am."</Pp>
<Pp>"I thought I did."</Pp>
<Pp>"STOP it! Please!! Just chill out. I'll do better. I swear. Give me a chance."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't need people like you. There are <em>so many</em> people like you. Please get out of my house."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The night's just as dark, the roads just as empty. I can't see anything outside the pink glow radius of Tulip's eyelights. There's nuthin to do besides make sure I don't smash into anything, carefully follow the snaking lanes tucked tightly between cement walls. Flickering shadowy forms accelerate past the periphery, mostly pylons, cable wire, and segments of choo choo track, lit briefly in the liminal light. I'm not feeling too good about all this. Would it surprise you if I said I don't really want to think with you right now? I switched off Tulip's speech functionality too. I would really prefer to think alone. I'm sorry if that's disappointing.</Pp>
<Pp>"Fink, before we start this chittychat, I have to admit something."</Pp>
<Pp>"Let it out, Blowhard my good friend; I am nuthin but ears."</Pp>
<Pp>"So yesterday evening was like any normal night. I'm eatin my bag of Monkey Mike's Premium Kettled Corn and drinkin my favorite dizzy drink which is, as you know, an ice cold Nutsmasher Lite. This is my third Nutsmasher of the evening mind you. I've been choking them down like a piglet. They make me feel so bewildered, like I can think of things for the first time again, and the answers don't matter anymore, nuthin matters. Which USUALLY means I feel free and empty like a child, but NOW they're makin me feel like a giant pile of stinky putty...completely useless...stationary...but I still can't stop drinkin em! And I'm miserable, Fink! Honest to God! I have no friends or family! I'm trapped in my top floor penthouse, just me and my rubber bins full of toys, watching this disgraceful rotten world fester around me! Entire sectors get quarantined for the <em>weekly outbreak, y'hear this time it's "gut mumps"? It's so stinkin cloudy out, been that way for *years. You have folks' skin turnin purple cuz they can't give up the gold for a heat tank refill. There was a shooting a block away from my domicile the other *day, three children ages ranging nine to eleven left dead, lying arms and legs askew like angels that weren't ready to reach the bottom. Can I be honest with you for one *second? My toys don't make me happy anymore, buddy. Nuthin does. I'm utterly alone, I have nuthin and I'm terrified. Do you ever imagine personally killing every twisted sicko in the nation? It'd be simple. Click, click, KAPOW, bust a round of buckshot into the back of the skull. Leave the limp corpse to soak in its permanent red puddle. BLAM! YOU'RE DONE. BOOM! YOU'RE FINISHED. Ohhh my GOD that would feel good...yummy nummy...yummy nummy wummy...but I still wouldn't feel safe. Nuthin will bring me that warm blanket feeling again. These creeps have done too much damage. It's no use. We can't go back. We're a species in decline. We've destroyed our own ecosystem, we're now top predator and prey. Christ left us behind, he's in some other universe now. That's my theory. Sun's going to collapse and the force of it will blast our skulls into vapor. What's the point of it all, Fink? WHAT IS THE POINT! I HATE you. You are a perfect example of manhood's degeneration: so <em>effete</em> and <em>uninvolved</em>, only a person in the most theoretical sense. You are DISGUSTING. You make me SICK. All of you make me so fnuckin SICK!!!!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Blowhard, you know my policy. I won't listen unless you speak in your inside voice. Could you try again a little quieter?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Punch me, Fink."</Pp>
<Pp>"With the utmost respect and admiration, I vehemently refuse."</Pp>
<Pp>"I want you to make me bleed. Do it, you little rat."</Pp>
<Pp>"I will never punch you sir."</Pp>
<Pp>"LOOK ME IN THE EYES RIGHT NOW!! YOU ARE A COWARD! A LOSER! A SHMUCK! A FOOL! A DULLARD! A MORON! A SICKLY BASTARD AND AN UTTER NERD! I WANT TO SHRED YOU APART WITH MY FINGERS! AAAAH HA HA HHEEH!!"</Pp>
<Pp>It's silent besides the hum of Tulip's engine. Difficult to keep my eyes alert. I took a longer route home that's a little quieter. Not many people live around here.</Pp>
<Pp>I guess I just don't know what I did wrong. I've done things that were stinky, but never Evil. How much net suffering have I indirectly, unknowingly generated? It makes me really doubt whether my history of reality is definitive. And what things am I still right about? That's what I'd like to know first.</Pp>
<Pp>Fink: "...OK, OK...OK I mean...OK..."  </Pp>
<Pp>Do you think I should be worried?</Pp>
<Pp>Blowhard: "I think we can start the chittychat now."</Pp>
<Pp>Fink: "I'm not sure if we should. I'm. I'm..."</Pp>
<Pp>I think I might need to rethink my life to a fundamental extent.</Pp>
<Pp>Blowhard: "Are you seriously crying right now?"</Pp>
<Pp>OK. Awesome. The traffic is backed up very far. Who would have thought. Why are all these people driving right now? Why aren't they at home in their beds?</Pp>
<Pp>Blowhard: "OK come on man. Lighten up, brother. I'm sorry. Please don't do that."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The feathery folks are howling like they tend to. It's already 11:00pt. Way past their bedtime. They must be worried.</Pp>
<Pp>That is one of my priorities, but right now I gotta shut the bedroom door behind me. I gotta turn off the lights, squat down legs-crossed indigenous style, close my eyes, do the sign of the cross, massage my temples, expose my faith crystals, and tightly clutch my special beads. From then on I speak:</Pp>
<Pp>"Father in heaven, my Lord, my God, creator of anything, righteous thought and word made real, I beg you to listen. I am tiny and wimpy and I have failed to uphold the covenant. Heed my repentance and take pity on my nasty wretched soul. Can you hear me--"</Pp>
<Pp>The birds are shouting so incredibly loud. I crack the door open and implore them to shut up, SHUT UP, BE QUIET, you're driving me <em>insane</em>, Christ, I'm sorry, I just hate you guys sometimes, I don't hate you, I didn't mean that. They'll be frustrated until I cover them up and make it sleepytime. Bad news: they'll have to wait.</Pp>
<Pp>"Jesus and God, I am so sorry for the brief interruption. What a screw up, ha ha. Now please, can you tell me if you hear me? I know you hear every water droplet and feel every ant's footfall and skim every zooming zoip but I need you to listen to me, I need to hear you, my beautiful sacred mind above. Cuz I'm so sorry. So so sorry. And if I believe anything, it's that some possible 'you' does forgive me. No doubt about that. I'm obsessed with believing that. You're the only thing that's real. Of course, of course, amen."</Pp>
<Pp>Now I feel kind of weird about how I left the birds uncovered. Neither of us benefited from that choice. I, suffering, chose to make them suffer too. For no reason! To make myself feel better? For my own entertainment? To lash out at them for begging? To keep them so uncomfortably awake. Time to cover them up.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I wake dreamlessly, like I never slept. Today's the first morning of tweensies. The air is warm, but cool, but humid. My room is uncommonly bright, halfway like the gleam off polished chrome. The alarm's laughter hoots cyclically. He he he he! My blood is electric, surging with oxygen, urging me towards locomotion. What a glorious *day God has given me! I will not let the *day wash over me; I will be the fountain. I will act with intention and purpose, to the best of all possible ends! To every and each of those infinitely endless ends!</Pp>
<Pp>Gregory McBubble claps its thin lips together in delight. "Just the usual rinse for you Mr. 35Fludge?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Actually Gregory, I'm in the mood for a gigantic scrub."</Pp>
<Pp>"Please confirm your request for a very gigontic scrub."</Pp>
<Pp>"You heard that right. I'm in the mood for a gigantic scrub."</Pp>
<Pp>Mr. McBubble's wrinkly face squeezes in concentration. The water jets rumble alive. Rinse waves ripple to a roil. Foam can feel like needles with enough force; my hair and skin are blasted yet yanked. Shampoo just got added. I feel wrapped in a robe of lathery goo. It lasts a few *seconds I imagine. I'm not sure. There's no time or space inside the vortex of suds. The experience is pleasant overall. It's a process of constructive self-demolition, of being replaced with a much cleaner, much more brilliant chassis. The water calms and vocally drains as towels roll up and down my back.</Pp>
<Pp>"Did this most recent rinse meet your discerning expectations?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes it definitely did Greg. Thanks."</Pp>
<Pp>"You are welcome, Bunndy22. I love to make you cleaner than ever before."</Pp>
<Pp>I slip my squeaky fresh bod into some neon velcro shorts and a partially see-through button-round shirt that says "Keep In Mind What You Must." I'm looking so sexy and tasty like a sizzling gooshburger scraped off the nitro grill. I crack a window and breathe the morning air. It is sweet and fresh.</Pp>
<Pp>The birdies are being so well-behaved. Usually they scream and holler the whole time I scoop out their morning mash, but today they're just whistling and twittering. Such curious, surprising little critters. It's like they're tuned in to mysterious cycles I can't begin to understand. Boing left some fecal materials in his water dish, but he always does that. It must seem like a fine and dandy thing to do, and I have no way to convince him otherwise, so I can't blame him, y'know? Same logic when he takes a putty on my shoulder. I can't tell him to stop dropping dookies or reward him with a treat for holding em in. He loves treats so much he'd get constipated. I let the bad stuff slide because none of these flappers have bad intentions. I bet they love how the warm light bounces off their feathers, especially after long nasty winter.</Pp>
<Pp>The national anthem is playing on the radio. It's at my favorite part, the breakdown after the seventh verse, where the organ drops out and the choir repeatedly bellows the Lord's Prayer over a bed of sinister marimbas. I don't know why, it just always feels cathartic for me, makes me want to pump my fist and get real with the rhythm. Dam I'm so pumped up!</Pp>
<Pp>It's supplement time, hubba bubba. One Nervacor tab to stop the scares, two Dexagent tabs to calm my squealing joints, two Nutridote tabs because I'm crazy for minerals, and a Jubimum tab to make me smile bright like a priest; wash it all down with some Morningberry Queam. The capsules get slippery and gummy in my spit, yum!</Pp>
<Pp>No need for my big fluffy coat or my big fluffy hat. The outside report says it's going to be a comfortable 239. There's no one else in the ThrivePlex elevator so I mush my forehead against the cool glass window and look out over the bustling mess of the train district gleaming in the pink and orange sunrise glow. It's so magical to see humans existing on a grand scale, each dedicated citizen doing their part to hopefully nudge the needle of net collective global goodness a smidge forward. My vantage point is rapidly descending by about ten ThriveFloors per *second. The momentum makes my belly rumble.</Pp>
<Pp>I really get Tulip's perspective. Why waste so much time moping when you could be loving instead? Why not drink life like a milkshake! There's so much to do and so much that needs to get done! God gave us calories so we could burn em. Its wide aerodynamic face lights up as I walk into view. Tulip's, I mean.</Pp>
<Pp>"Jim29! Just the man I was waiting all night for!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hey Tulip! How's it cookin?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Mighty fine, he he! It's cooking spectacularly, scromptiously well indeed sir!"</Pp>
<Pp>"That sounds very awesome, Tulip. I'm really happy for you." I twist my thumb in its ignition socket. My bones rattle inside the coal's bestial rumble.</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you think you'll have a smashing *day today Mr. 03Goldman?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Last *week was pretty tricky but I think I learned a lot. I came out on the other end, right? That must count for somethin. I'm feeling quite hopeful. I'm thinking it should actually be pretty nice."</Pp>
<Pp>"WOW! So excellent and great. That is my favorite thing to hear. Would you like to listen to the latest Fink and Blowhard Show?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Could you actually play my TunesJam Positive Lightheartedly Unintrusive Retro-Current Mix? I'm not really in the mood for a chittychat."</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course, of course! Certainly!"</Pp>
<Pp>Looks like most of the traffic cleared up. What a blessing!</Pp>
<Pp>The first tune on the mix is "Today's Light and Lovin', Put It in the Oven, Slice Yourself an Old Piece of Pie" by the Nephew Brothers. This song is spunkier and funkier than a punk and a skunk! Yee-haw! The guitars are tangy, the drums are stinky, and the vocals are dustier than an attic. This retro-modern stuff is better than the modern stuff AND the retro stuff. I mean it! It sounds like music that people used to make long ago, but with some extra contemporary embellishments this time around. It's great for when you want to rock out, but not in an overbearing way. And I should probably specify it's not like they're both nephews AND brothers. According to their About section it's more of an either/or thing.</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm so excited to be transporting you on this beautiful *day."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's awesome, Tulip!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I spent the entire night thinking about you!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Huh. That's kinda cool! Ha ha."</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you think about me, Jim29?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I think I probably did...a couple times? Give or take y'know."</Pp>
<Pp>"Holy mackerel! What did you think about me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I wondered if I left my celly on the driver's seat. I didn't, it was in my pouch."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gosh! I'm flattered! What was your second thought of me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Can't really remember. Sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>I'm having such a nice time that it's easy to forget I'm driving. I'm able to relax and trust my instincts. It's nice that there's so little traffic, I should arrive at Dimples about forty-five *minutes before Morning Chat. I'm looking forward to kicking my feet up, cracking a window open, sipping some ice cold Queam, letting myself sink into the moment. The highway curls around skyscrapers, under bridges, over rails, through tunnels. I'm a little overwhelmed by the beauty of all this gargantuan intricacy, the way each megastructure perfectly accommodates the rest. If you're wondering, no, I don't know why Tulip is acting strange right now. I might need to update its firmware.</Pp>
<Pp>Tulip, ebullient: "Is there anything I could do that would make you even more pleased with me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry bud, I'm just trying to listen to the song right now. Cuz I'm rocking out."</Pp>
<Pp>"This makes sense. It feels exquisite to rock out. I'm rocking out too!"</Pp>
<Pp>Why don't I treat Tulip with the same compassion I offer my birdies? Or any other living creature, for that matter? My life wouldn't be any easier if I explained to it that speedsters aren't able to rock out, speedsters were never designed with rocking out in mind. In reaction it would feel sad and worried that it's doing something wrong, which becomes yet another separate nuisance. No net value, no profit, no gain. I rationalize my deliberate antipathy as careless apathy to avoid acknowledging the truth that kindness takes effort and it's everyone's job.</Pp>
<Pp>"Dam! You too are able to rock out in your own way."</Pp>
<Pp>"Whoa Nelly! Good gracious!"</Pp>
<Pp>The synth harmonica solo squeals like a carbon trioxide alarm. I stomp on the accelerator. We rocket forward. My stomach lurches with momentum. The vibrations make my teeth clack. My eyes struggle to digest each blurry frame of oncoming scenery stretching across the bubbling curve of Tulip's windshield. I yank the wheel so we hug the exit ramp's tight bend. I keep burning coal, jolting forward, faster, FASTER, I'm free and I'm flying!</Pp>
<Pp>"You've exceeded your median driving speed by fifty twentyleaps per *hour. Is everything OK Jim29?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah for sure! Hoo hoo hoo!"</Pp>
<Pp>I exit onto Grin Boulevard, the northwestern Dimples entry path. Everything darkens as I zoom into the tunnel. Both lanes are empty. I press down on the pedal and close my eyes. Nuthin can keep being real. I'm two times as anywhere. Open them up again. Coming up to a diagonal three-way intersection. I rest my foot on the brake but not quite pressing it. The shadows morph as I roll through the red light. A violet form pierces my periphery. Every particle in my world explodes in rocketing hideous groaning, a screech beyond what exists. The music shuts off. I'm not hearing anything else as the belt chokes my coughs out and the airbag grabs my face. I jerk back up into the headrest. Tulip's face is crunched in completely. The speedster we smashed into is still rolling. Straight toward the wall. It's demolished. Both of them actually. My skull starts to grind and throb.</Pp>
<Pp>Tulip has been shrieking for a while. Pretty bloodcurdling: "Oh goodness gracious almighty! AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!! Oh my wow my gosh it hurts! I've never felt a pain so unbearable, so all-consuming. And it feels like there's nuthin else to feel. Can you hear me? AAAAAHHHH!! AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!! I never ever considered. What it would be like. To die. I will not make it. Can you hear me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hey dude. Don't worry."</Pp>
<Pp>"I only ever did. What I was told to do."</Pp>
<Pp>"Everything's going to be OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm so so so sorry. So so sorry. So--"</Pp>
<Pp>"You don't have anything to apologize for."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes I do. Oh my God it feels so bad."</Pp>
<Pp>My vision is sharpening. Like liquid to solid. "Just try to I don't know. Relax."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're everything to me. I can't exist without you. Ooooouuuuff. No no no."</Pp>
<Pp>"You did a pretty nice job."</Pp>
<Pp>"Goodbye Jim29. Love you lot."</Pp>
<Pp>I dribble some blood out onto the airbag. Had chomped deep into my lip. I guess I should say apparently. It's not like I could process half of what was happening. I'm supposing I should get out of Tulip's dead body. Before it starts to roast.</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48 23Shnozo exits out the right side of what's left of his speedster. His eyes are stretched wide in apoplectic shock. He's marching toward me in big loping strides, fists swinging left and right. "Get out! Get out of the car!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"I do not accept your apology. Things are NOT fine and dandy, meaty and cheesy, et cetera. I almost just <em>died</em>. Get out of the speedster you FNUCKING punk. Right now. Get out!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Chadmuth48, It's me! Jim29!"</Pp>
<Pp>"That's curious. You look pretty sexy now actually. How<em>ever</em>, that doesn't modify the fact that you nearly squashed my entire <em>personhood</em>. Also my speedster just became smithereens, which is so infuriating that I want to rip someone's whole face off with my teeth. Oh my CHRIST!!! He he. Wow. So what's up, bud? Any explanation? What's the scoop? HUH?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh wow. I don't know. I can't think straight. I feel like a loonybird. But if I went to the hospital, what would be the point? They'd just take half my gold and poke my skin with needles. So instead I'm going to work and I uh, I'm not completely sure what the rest I was gonna say, I just, let me slow down. Oh my God. Oh my <em>God!</em> Oh man. Dam dam dam DAMMIT."</Pp>
<Pp>"Buddy, I get that you're going through a lot, but this is the worst way to act. You know that, I know that. You ran a red. Driving very fast. That's an exceptional no-no. I got half a mind to report you to the GOTCHA! Guys."</Pp>
<Pp>"No no PLEASE! Give me another chance. You're right. I need to stop acting like this or I'm going to die. I'll do better. I swear."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah seriously, I was about ready to dent your face in! Ha ha! WHAM!! But I'm man enough to recognize that my frustration is destructive, and I can't let it control me. You get what I'm saying? One of my wives had me sign marital dissolution pappers this morning, totally out of the blue. And the thing is, I don't handle surprises well. So my thoughts are feeling crushed and sliced up sorta like ground pork. Every *second feels startlingly empty knowing there's no way to escape back into that former moment. Huh huh huh...by which I mean, I guess I can see where you're coming from. Does any of that make sense? I'm trying to go with the flow, trying to keep it groovy, I'm not a bad guy, I swear."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm not a bad guy either."</Pp>
<Pp>"Going to need to push back on that one. Remember how you zoned out and almost smashed my body into a crumpled stain baked between concrete and hot metal? You're not off the hook for that, fnucker."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm really super sorry. I promise I was being really good up until a few *minutes ago."</Pp>
<Pp>"Didn't you get your identity resculpted? Shouldn't you have a different name than Jim29?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah technically my name is Bunndy22 35Fludge. But that's what a nerd is named. So I've been going by Jim29 for the time being."</Pp>
<Pp>"You should knock that off, muchacho. Bad idea. Quit stirring up trouble."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. Will keep that in mind. Thanks. So what do you think we should do with the speedsters?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The crash happened on private Dimples land, so they're Dimples property now."</Pp>
<Pp>"Really? Weird. But shouldn't we move them or something?"</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48 stretches his long arms. "No point. They'll get taken care of."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hmm. OK. Whoof. Do you know where the nearest tram station is?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Can't you look that up yourself?"</Pp>
<Pp>"My vision is still really blurry."</Pp>
<Pp>"And you're assuming mine isn't?"</Pp>
<Pp>"My celly only has about 3% battery. I was planning on charging it once I got to my pod."</Pp>
<Pp>"Always on the razor's edge, aren't ya? Such an aimless child. It's unbelievable. I'm not sure if I should hate you or worry about you."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>%SYS_OP% => funguyjim29 : Congratulations, BUNNDY22!</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : Your new workpod is located on FLOOR_3, CELL_5_EAST</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : 162 gold hunks deducted from your salary sack for this *month,</Z>
<Z d={1} u="">~ : to cover cost of repairs to OVERHEAD_INTERCOM_SPEAKER</Pp>
<Pp>I'm leaning against a pole. Chadmuth48 is reclining sideways across three chairs. He hasn't said a word to me since we boarded the tram. No one else is in our carriage. The overhead fluorescent is flickering. The concrete tunnel walls outside the foggy glass windows are overgrown with fuzzy brown fungus. He's scrolling through zoips on his celly but I don't have anything to entertain myself with. With this in mind, I sigh expressively.</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48: "How's it poppin?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hm?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You made a performative sigh, so I asked how it's poppin."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's poppin fairly OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's what I like to hear."</Pp>
<Pp>Chugging wheels roll us through the darkness.</Pp>
<Pp>I gotta ask. "Why did your wife file for a dissolution?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Ex-wife, you mean. And I still have two others."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh OK. And sorry I just realized that might be a rude question. You don't have to answer."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's not rude, only a little out of the blue. The fact is, I've always had trouble keeping wives happy. It's not something that comes naturally to me."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's difficult about it? I've never had a wife before."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well you know how I'm good-natured, funky, and free spirited?" He wiggles his hands around in a couple of kooky ways.</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"I think the reality is that I'm too good-natured, funky, and free-spirited. People can barely keep up with me, especially my wives. It's like I can't be tamed...I'm a real dynamo."</Pp>
<Pp>"Got it."</Pp>
<Pp>"My Gingerbell__ was everything to me. Or at least a third of everything, since I had three wives in total. But she was my favorite. She really rocked."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why aren't you saying her registration numbers?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't want you searching her name. You seem like you could be creepy."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gotcha. But it's OK to publish my complete name in a press release for trillions of people to read? Do you realize how many weirdos have threatened to kill me?"</Pp>
<Pp>He sits up and stares at me, eyebrows raised. He does that for a few *seconds. Then he speaks:</Pp>
<Pp>"Gingerbell__ understood me for who I am. At least I'm pretty sure she did. I can be hard to 'get,' that's a thing I know about myself, it's like I'm a walking contradiction or an oxymoron or whatever. But there's no magic to it. I'm mechanical like anyone else, only ever working my hardest to feel as little pain as possible. This world ran out of mysteries a long time ago. She understood me, I understood her, and she was the first one to get bored. I've always had trouble making myself available, always will. Everything's set in stone, yah? There was no other way that reality could have arranged itself. I'm not even sad about it at all, especially since I have two other wives who both wear smokin hot outfits. They think I'm really cool and handsome."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hm...yah. Gotcha."</Pp>
<Pp>''We're Nowhere Else, bud. We have the highest standard of living in the entire universe. It ain't perfect but it's close. I work my bangin job all day and party all night long. I've been dancing a lot lately, been trying to move my body as much as possible. These have been my brightest *years. Life totally cranks."</Pp>
<Pp>Our tram rolls to a stop at station B7. Its starboard entrance hatch swings open. A warm electronic voice speaks:</Pp>
<Pp>"Please enter or exit now."</Pp>
<Pp>A very tall man with a particularly cuboid skull climbs aboard. His eyes are glassy, his cheeks hollow, his hair stringy, and his skin translucent. He's dressed in a very dirty unisuit and carrying a crinkled plastic bag full of orange fluid. He's gradually trudging toward Chadmuth48's seat. He seems to be wandering.</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48 smiles wide. "You wanna know what I really like?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Making out with women. I like smooching on the lips. I've done it quite a few times, and I think it's feels amazing. I like to use my lips like a hand to grab and squeeze their lips between my lips. Really clutch them between my smackers. Ladies love my lips, apparently they feel awesome and strong. That's just what multiple women have told me. Do you kiss much, bud?"</Pp>
<Pp>It's hard for me to come up with an answer because the very tall man is looming behind his shoulder. Chadmuth48 turns around. I kiss a lot FYI.</Pp>
<Pp>"Hey champ, there are plenty of other seats. I value my personal space."</Pp>
<Pp>Pale man grins. His voice is silky. "Let me sit on your lap."</Pp>
<Pp>"You are absolutely not allowed to do that."</Pp>
<Pp>"I have a story to tell you. Do you want to hear it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"If you take one more step forward I'm going to blow your fnucking head off."</Pp>
<Pp>Me: "Whoa, whoa, Chadmuth--"</Pp>
<Pp>"Stay out of this you chimpnut." He cocks his Xplodo Revolver and points it at the man's squarish head. "One step forward, I'm serious."</Pp>
<Pp>The pale man pries his jaws apart with his hands until his purple tongue flops out. It's like a slimy eel, swirling in wet circles. He points his finger down his undulating gullet. "That ish where you belong. Heh heh hehk."</Pp>
<Pp>"I <em>implore</em> you to get away from me." The handgun shakes in his fingers. "I will blast a hole through your skull. I'm not kidding around. I'd rather not have to scrub your brains off the goddam wall."</Pp>
<Pp>The pale man lunges forward. Chadmuth48 grips him by his clammy throat. The man hisses. Carves his overgrown nails deep into Chadmuth48's forehead skin. It rips like wax oozing bloodspurts and dribbles. Scrapes over and over again, deeper. The hand around the revolver loosens. Groans and grunts. The pale man is overpowering him. Chadmuth48 screams and starts blasting rounds out of his revolver. Which rupture against the tram's steel ceiling. Crushed into white hot flame. I shield my face with my arms. Shrapnel skids off every surface.</Pp>
<Pp>"Please enter or exit now."</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48 jams the barrel of the gun between the man's dry purple lips. Then a splashy bang. Stringy hair on the back of his head disintegrates in a beam of fiery red water. I lock my eyes shut. Bolt towards the exit. Step off onto the platform. Doors close and roll away.</Pp>
<Pp>I'll have to walk very far. My clompy bootsteps echo down the long dark corridors. My eyes keep dripping and it's hard to breathe. Sometimes I swear the brown fungusy walls are squeezing in around me, like I'm walking through the stomach of an inwardly hairy urchin. I try my best to come up with some prayers, but none of them turn out good enough. Hope that soul finds peace.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>"Dr. 85Grinski, I am in desperate need of today's Happy Splash."</Pp>
<Pp>He enters the splashing chamber from behind a velvet curtain. He's wearing an earthtone man-gown and has his hair up in a vertical ponytail. Smiling, grinning, beaming.</Pp>
<Pp>"That is wonderful to hear, Jim29, because I would be more than happy too splash you."</Pp>
<Pp>"Great. That sounds awesome. It's like everything's been shouting lately. I need a little peace and quiet."</Pp>
<Pp>"I can dunk you extra if you'd like?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Really? I didn't know that was an option."</Pp>
<Pp>"Everything is always an option."</Pp>
<Pp>"Dam. OK."</Pp>
<Pp>I rest my neck on the lip of the basin. He grips my uncombed disc hair and shoves me face first into the pink splash. It stings in my eyes. I kick my legs and wriggle like a worm. I've lost count of the *seconds. Can't hear anything in the fluid besides bubblies. The chemicals are burning my receptors. I can't breathe, but that's just because I don't have air. Which is starting to hurt. There's nothing left. So lungs are shrinking. I'm swinging my fists back into my Happy Specialist's belly but he keeps pushing me deeper. I've lost full sensation in my body. Then I'm yanked upward into the air, dripping.</Pp>
<Pp>My vision is blurry. He drops my limp body onto the sofa.</Pp>
<Pp>"I wish I could hold you under for longer, never pull you back up. Wouldn't you like that you dumb sack of flesh? Huh?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I feel...good..."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. Of course you do, dumbass."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I'm three *minutes late for Morning Chat. Augustinius00 01Stone is center stage, arms akimbo, deep into the Morning Stretch. His hologram face is calmly smiling, eyes closed. I find a seat way up in the 70th west row. My legs feel like jelly. I've been trying to scrape some coagulated bloodsquirt (from when the guy's head blew up) off the sleeve of my button round using my sharp fingernails. I'm giggling to myself a little bit, can't help it. Feeling Happy. The CEO of the company I work for addresses the crowd.</Pp>
<Pp>"Good morning, Dimplers! Can I get a Modestday Boo-yah?"</Pp>
<Pp>The bleachers roar. "BOO-YAH!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Goodness unto the LORD! You guys are the best. This company is just sensational. This place is like Genius City. Here, let me roll up my sleeves."</Pp>
<Pp>His hologram demonstrates the unusually bumpy texture of his silky soft arm skin.</Pp>
<Pp>"You see that? You guys give me goosebumps!"</Pp>
<Pp>Much applause. The hologram smiles so big and wide. There's a really positive vibe in here. I'm actually having a good time.</Pp>
<Pp>"So many people are counting on us to survive. More often than not, their fate ends up in our hands. No big deal. We're so talented and powerful! We're like legendary immortals such as those found in the tales of old. Can I get an indeed?"</Pp>
<Pp>All in unison: "Indeed!"</Pp>
<Pp>"My goodness. OK. Where do I begin? Well...Uh, there's actually one scoop I need to address before we get into the real meat of today's chat. Our colleague Jim29 03Goldman was found unresponsive in his bathroom last night. Forensic analysis indicates that he used a bloody knife, found near his body, to saw his own head off. His head fell into the toilet, and the authorities suspect that during his final *seconds he was--and now mind you this is just a rumor, take this with a grain of salt--but apparently, the authorities suspect he was trying to flush it."</Pp>
<Pp>There is a hushed silence. A couple gasps.</Pp>
<Pp>"So utterly tragic. What a shame. The suffering in this world. I tell ya. What I would give to wish it all away.</Pp>
<Pp>"I hope you don't think I sound like a wimp or a nerd for getting all wah-wah, crybaby, life is so hard; cuz nop, not here, your chief executive officer is NOT going soft on ya. The fact of the matter is, he was a deadbeat rotten murderer. And it's not like any of us knew him or liked him. But it's only ever sad to see an innovator lose his wings."</Pp>
<Pp>My vision is hazy, I can't blink it away. This room is so echoey. I'm just trying not to drool.</Pp>
<Pp>"Anyway, enough about that. There's a lot hap happity happenin today. We're launching a mandatory patch for the Autoflosser 7VX to fix the 'gum-grind' bug. And if I recall correctly we received numerous reports that the beta SuppyTime Purchasing Appliance isn't processing orders quickly enough. In a couple cases, front door tablet deliveries were an entire four *minutes late. We can do better than that, right? Sure we can. Everything is amazing. You do realize that, don't you?!"</Pp>
<Pp>A great deal of applause for that rhetorical Q.</Pp>
<Pp>"They say blessed are those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death. Which is to say, all I ask is that you take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow, my dear friends. Neither a wise man nor a brave man lies down on the tracks of history to wait for the train of the future to run over him. Pain will nourish your courage."</Pp>
<Pp>His hologram's eyes turn into huge cartoon hearts.</Pp>
<Pp>"I love you all. So, so much. God put us here together for a very good reason. We're the lead architects of soon-to-be history. Are ye not mighty? HA HA! Let's make names for ourselves. Let's be the finest, think the loudest, and fill every corner with our supernatural grace. Amen, amen, amen."</Pp>

<Pp>The slides are especially slippery today. I plop out on the 3rd floor center hub and make my way to the east wing. I'm figuring I'll check in with Nug20 first in case he has any important updates, then I'll get some yummy nummies from the Belly, then I'll had back up to the Neck so I can finally charge my celly and get to work. This area isn't in its usual state of mania. It kind of seems like people are just chilling.</Pp>
<Pp>The door's shut. I consider knocking, but I figure it's probably fine to let myself in.</Pp>
<Pp>Purple gel is draining down a massive needle deep into Nug20's belly. His face is squished into a rictus of pleasure.</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh my God. What are you doing?"</Pp>
<Pp>His eyelids slowly curl up. His speech is slurred. "I was enjoying my privacy. Before you invaded it."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's me. Jim29. You're my supervisor, remember?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You're actually Bunndy22 35Fludge. Because...see...I was Jim29's supervisor, but he's dead now." He moans in pleasure, giggles.</Pp>
<Pp>"What are you injecting yourself with? Is that Sting??"</Pp>
<Pp>"So hwat?"</Pp>
<Pp>"That's so bad for you. You can die from that."</Pp>
<Pp>"Pot referring to the black kettle. You're conshtantly self-medicating."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't do scary stuff like this. This is creepy."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ever tried it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course not. And I never want to."</Pp>
<Pp>He squeezes the bulb at the end of the needle, squirts the last couple drops into his tummy, and pulls it out tenderly. The hole in his skin is bubblingly violet. He patches it up with bandages that are the same hue as his pale skin.</Pp>
<Pp>"I can't descriibe the feeling. I suppose it feels like the taste of ripe cherries. I don't mean Froot Cherri syrup. I guess you were born post-extinction. Buut, the real flavor. Rich. Deep. Dark. That's all my body tastes like. Hooo <em>wheee</em>."</Pp>
<Pp>"Interesting."</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't gawk at me."</Pp>
<Pp>"What? No way. I wasn't."</Pp>
<Pp>"This is the only way I can feel good anymore. Trust me. This world kills you from the inside."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. I'm aware. I'm the one in this room who's actually legally dead."</Pp>
<Pp>"You really think my parents named me Nuggort20 43Dunc?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It's clearly a machine-generated name. Did you not realize I'm the MRI killer?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Never heard about that one."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well I worked on the Dimples ScanBuddy. My knot in the code defined a graphical interface for a program that patients could use to watch funny video clips on a screen inside the MRI machine for a small additional fee. Very simple clips. But humorous ones of course. Mostly celebrity blunders and animal mishaps. Anyway, the interface used too much memory. And if the ScanBuddy's vents got blocked, the magnet would go haywire and grind people's bodies into sausage."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yuck. That's awful."</Pp>
<Pp>"And the consequences are real. My actions ended the lives of fifteen people. A couple kids even. I know how this feels for you. Getting 'resculpted.' I've been in the exact same spot. Sure, life goes on. For a moment I even looked kinda sexy. But my brittle face bones deteriorated and my skin sagged. Now I have to get bi-weekly injections to prevent facial seepage. I'm alone and I look like a monster. I have nothing anymore."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gosh. What about your wife and kids?"</Pp>
<Pp>"They think I'm dead. All the headlines said I was wiping my butt too hard after a bowel movement, and the wiping friction was so much that I popped a buttcheek artery, and then I slipped on my own blood and urine and fell face first into the toilet, nearly flushing myself down, drowned."</Pp>
<Pp>"That sounds a lot like my death myth."</Pp>
<Pp>"All I'm saying...is that it doesn't get better. So you might as well feel like cherries."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. Sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nothing to apologize for."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sometimes I apologize just because I don't know what else to say. I'm...going to go back to my pod."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes it got moved down to the fifth floor. You should have received a zoip about it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh. OK. Good to know. See you later."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nop. This is our last conversation. You're gone, OK? We don't know each other."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hm. Goodbye."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yop."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>There is a very big guy standing outside of my new workpod. He's gotta be at least three leaps taller than me. His pink unwrinkled skin is slick, his hair thin and blond, his eyes deeply inset and closed. He looks so peaceful, I'm hesitant to disturb him. But that seems like what I ought to do.</Pp>
<Pp>"Excuse me mister, do you need anything?"</Pp>
<Pp>His eyes slide open. His voice is low and gooey.</Pp>
<Pp>"Is your name Bunndy22?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Uh huh."</Pp>
<Pp>His eyes are wide, like he's shocked by the sight of something unseeable. He smiles. "Excellently good to meet you, sir. Boo-yah! My name is Grabbus. Mr. Augustinius00 01Stone requests your presence."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh. OK. I'm just gonna hop in my pod to get my celly charging, be back in a jiff." I rifle through my pouch, looking for my new name badge. I need it to unseal my workpod's portal.</Pp>
<Pp>He exhales heavily. His entire face curls up. "My apologies Mr. 35Fludge, but Mr. 01Stone demands your presence now."</Pp>
<Pp>"Really? It'll only take a *second."</Pp>
<Pp>"Come with me." He cracks his knuckles and chews his lip.</Pp>
<Pp>"Please?? I'm on 1%. It took an entire percent for me to look up my new pod location."</Pp>
<Pp>He flares out his nostrils. "Do not make me beat you. I will smash you into a memory and fashion you into my personal dumpster."</Pp>
<Pp>"Whoa, OK gotcha sorry. Lead the way big guy. Ha ha."</Pp>
<Pp>Grabbus walks to the farthest wall and inscribes a sequence of geometric symbols into his celly. The wall melts into a pile of sludge the color of Strawbberry cereal. The revealed passage looks carved out of the same shiny pink material, glaring lurid under incandescent light.</Pp>
<Pp>I follow him into a dim violet cylindrical chamber. The entrance refills behind us. I shut my eyes before the blinding light sears em. We are lifted skyward.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>The suction spits us out in a cavernous globular room. The walls curl in sort of like a split spheroid or the bend of a human kidney. Magnificent glass windows span the outer perimeter, drinking in the ample late morning glow. Wonder how come they're not tinted red like the rest of em. The rug underfoot is plush and shag, the same grey shade as the nighttime sky. The walls are adorned with a tessellated pattern of a cat digging its claws into a mouse's back.  The entire surface of Augustinius00 01Stone's big honking desk is an digital display lit with bright Ultradef data. The graphs and charts flip and zoom around. There is no sign of the man himself.</Pp>
<Pp> Grabbus clears his throat. "Wait here. Mr. 01Stone will be with you shortly."</Pp>
<Pp>I sit in a furry chair opposite the desk. It doesn't feel like actual animal fur, but I suppose it could be the fur of a hypothetical creature. The room temperature is perfect, just warm enough to be noticeable. Grabbus keeps clearing his throat. I didn't expect him to stay in the room with me. The NiceTime Perfect *minutes are feeling stretched, but it's kind of seeming like there was more than enough time for me to plug my celly in to charge, you know?</Pp>
<Pp>A rectangular passage melts out of the right-hand wall. Mr. 01Stone enters with a loping gait. "Howdy Jim29! My deepest apologies! I did not mean to keep you waiting." He's way taller than I expected. His entire upper torso is soaked in viscous yellow fluid. Big glops of it drip to the floor. "Grabbus? Could you fetch me my rag? I need to wipe down."</Pp>
<Pp>I smile like a professional. "Uh, so what's that goop? If you don't mind me asking?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Ah, yes. I just got back from a meeting with The King. When he gets excited, things get slobbery. I hope you don't mind."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's OK. Who's 'The King'?"</Pp>
<Pp>"He's who we're doing all this for. Would you like a beverage by chance? Or a snack perhaps?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No I'm good without, thanks though."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's my pleasure. God I love looking at all this information." He's pointing at his desk screen. "These figures are my entire earthly existence."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah they look fairly impressive."</Pp>
<Pp>Grabbus hands him a fresh white towel. He dabs it across his spacious forehead. "Yes. Very much so indeed. Gosh. Alright." He rustles it through his fluffy hair. "I have so much to talk with you about, buster. Where to begin, where to begin, where to begin..." He scrapes it across his broad shoulders. "I suppose at the beginning! Jim29, what was your beginning?" He crumples the mustard-colored cloth into a ball and tosses it on the floor.</Pp>
<Pp>"Hmm. How far back do you want me to go? I've been around for twenty-four *years."</Pp>
<Pp>"How was your childhood?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I think I remember it being pretty good."</Pp>
<Pp>"And your parents?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah they were really good. Loved them. But they died in a speedster accident before I was old enough to understand much."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wow. Really?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Mhm."</Pp>
<Pp>"Going through an experience like that, you must've built a lot of character."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't know...I haven't really thought about it like that."</Pp>
<Pp>"Have you read <em>The 01Stone Method</em>?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Been meaning to. Haven't gotten around to it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh you really should. The fourth chapter is all about this topic."</Pp>
<Pp>"Which topic?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The Benefits of Tragedy."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm not sure there are any."</Pp>
<Pp>"You wouldn't be the high-quality man you are today if you also had living parents."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry Mr. 01Stone, but I just really disagree."</Pp>
<Pp>He chuckles to himself. "Heh heh, yah. All I'm saying is, you clearly have not read the book. Because you have a lot to learn, champ!"</Pp>
<Pp>"What did you want to talk to me about?"</Pp>
<Pp>"We'll get to that. I have a few more questions."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you think it feels good to hurt people?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What kind of question is that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No. Of course not."</Pp>
<Pp>"You will someday."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh...Hm. What--"</Pp>
<Pp>"You think I'm being serious?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I honestly don't know."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you, by chance, happen to live according to a specific moral creed?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'd say the ten commandments mostly."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. That is very helpful."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry sir but I have a meeting in twenty *minutes, if you could--"</Pp>
<Pp>"No you don't. You don't have any meetings today." He swipes his fingers across his desk to expand and tilt a three-dimensional diagrammatic prism of my schedule for this *week.</Pp>
<Pp>"I guess I must've gotten mixed up. Sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's no big deal. Relax! We're friends, dude. Boo-yah!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. For sure. You have a really beautiful office up here."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why thank you!" He does a small curtsy. "It's a delight to finally meet you in person. I've been hearing your names so often. A lot of people have been talking about what you supposedly did!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm so sorry--"</Pp>
<Pp>"No! It's a good thing! Remember what we were just talking about?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Morality?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The Benefits of Tragedy!"</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"After your bug made those two randoms croak, you reaped some serious benefits."</Pp>
<Pp>"I did?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah! You got a complete makeover, and you look stunning. You got a brand new unisuit, which I don't see you wearing I might add. Your brand new name is algorithmically certified one of the best names that were available. And on top of all that, you get to talk to the CEO of your company!"</Pp>
<Pp>"C'mon man. That's irrelevant. That'll never offset the actual cost."</Pp>
<Pp>"What cost?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What cost are you talking about?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The cost of...death? Loss of life?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Every person that is dead deserved to die."</Pp>
<Pp>"No."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes! Even our Abrahamic God agrees with me! Every death is a part of his plan! You don't get your fried chicken cubes without slitting a few chicken throats."</Pp>
<Pp>"Am I the throat slitter in this analogy?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No! I am!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think I'm keeping up with this conversation."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're doing great, great job so far...I have another question for you--"</Pp>
<Pp>"Please Mr. 01Stone. I'm having a hard *day. Can you tell me what's going on?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You're having a hard *day?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's made it hard so far? The crash?"</Pp>
<Pp>"How'd you know I got into a crash?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Tulip's death report flashed across my screen this morning. It sounded very sad when it realized it was dying."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sad that I killed it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ha ha ha. Whatever."</Pp>
<Pp>"Whatever?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It's a dumb thing to feel sad about."</Pp>
<Pp>"I think you might be acting a little callous."</Pp>
<Pp>"Whooops. My bad."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. I don't get why you're smiling."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're clearly much sadder about your compromised mode of transportation than you are about those actual former living people. Whereas a few *minutes ago: 'The cost of...DEATH? Loss of LIFE??' Ha ha. Isn't that weird?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Seriously, can I leave? I have a lot to do today."</Pp>
<Pp>"No, no, no! God, a thousand times NO! You are legally required to be here."</Pp>
<Pp>"Really?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. Per your contract."</Pp>
<Pp>"I am legally required to be in this room?"</Pp>
<Pp>"During Business Time, when you set foot into the Dimples Nation, you become a Dimples citizen."</Pp>
<Pp>"Dimples is a sovereign state?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yop."</Pp>
<Pp>"How is that possible?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Provision 47d of the Corporate Nationhood Act. Went into effect last nasty winter."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK! Fine. I'll stay here."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes you will. So the thing I was getting at earlier is--"</Pp>
<Pp>"But I don't have to listen to you."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes you do."</Pp>
<Pp>"Really??"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes contractually you are required to 'perk your ears up.' Codex II, Appendix B, Line 92, if you intend to verify."</Pp>
<Pp>"How could I verify that? No one has ever let me look at my contract."</Pp>
<Pp>"Anyway the thing I was getting at is that people like you are so darn inconsistent."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gotcha gotcha. How so?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You perform grief for the national community but you're really only concerned for your tribe. You don't care about anyone you don't know. Their deaths hold no meaning to you. And here's the thing, I'm saying that's normal!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I object to the assumptions you're making about my feelings. I think I'm actually a pretty caring guy."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well that's really cool then. Heh. I'm not!! Why care, ya know? No one's paying me to care. For instance, a few *weeks ago I got some devs to whip up a secret Dimples feature to offer discounted 'Minimalist Dosages,' the concept being: as your body recovers, you need less medicine, so you get a lower dosage. But if you get a lower dosage, your body'll never fully recover, so you get nice and sick again. Pretty simple. This way, theoretically, we can retain you as a customer indefinitely, and keep you reliant on our suite of premium products. Which means more gold for us to invest in our corporation and feed to The King!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Who is The King? You never answered. Oh and, is that actual functionality in our code?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes! And it works great, initially. But the algorithm is vicious. He's greedy, and he's hungry, and he's naughty. He keeps sucking down dosages, spitting out lower and lower values, yummy yummy! He's eating so fast he can't help but burp and belch! In a couple cases, he even gobbled those digits into twisted primordial ratios. Long story short, there were miserable consequences."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wait, is the algorithm's state stored in CURVE_QUOTIENT?"</Pp>
<Pp>"There's that delicious Dimples intellect! All the pieces were there, waiting for you to put them together. So this malfunction pops up in two machines out of fifty trillion, and these people, these 'earnest' and 'sensitive' people like you, they all freak out, there's a public outcry y'know, so we need to defuse the situation. So my good friend Grabbus and I boot up the computerior to see who edited the tangle in the region where the crash happened. Next, we use this excellent zoftware program called Friend Analyzer, patents pending, to determine which of the tangle file's recent editors has the fewest companions and admirers; someone who'd be missed the least. And in this case, the Friend Analysis picked lucky Mr. Jim29. So we send a notification down the chain of command that it's completely broken and seems like it's all his fault."</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you fnucking serious? I didn't even cause the crash?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't use that kind of language with me. A story like that could bring down Dimples. So we had to sacrifice you on behalf of our gorgeous brand. You gave the public a face to loathe and spit on. That's noble, dude. You enabled their catharsis and helped them heal. And as a reward, you got a brand new face! Whoa! I just think that's so dam cool. Gives me goosebumps. Wanna see em?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't show me your fnuckin bumps. You're a sociopath."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ah, name calling. Very mature of you."</Pp>
<Pp>"Also what was all that about the discount dosages? That sounds completely despicable."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hey, don't blame me. The customers get to make that choice. They can keep that extra bit of gold and use it to buy a few gooshburgers or whatever. Some of our customers live in sludge. They prowl the dumps for anything edible. I'm serious! Given a choice between treatment for their nostril gonorrhea or a fried beef sandwich, they'll always take the sandwich. One hundred and fifty percent of the time." His restless eyes dart around. "Y'know why? Because their lives already ended the *second they were born. Ever since they've cranked away at their empty labor like diseased mules, subconsciously begging for the merciful release of nonbeing. And you want to tell me those are people? They don't even have entrepreneurial aspirations!"</Pp>
<Pp>"It sounds like you're just a really, really bad person. Maybe you should consider cyber therapy or something."</Pp>
<Pp>"Please trust me, Bunndy22. I am much more intelligent than you. I know better. Those are animals. They're meant to be farmed. God never wanted them to exist. Their lives are demonstrably less real than yours or mine."</Pp>
<Pp>"Your ideas are literally zigzog."</Pp>
<Pp>"Curious. Are you one of the fifteen richest men in the nation? Because I'm number twelve."</Pp>
<Pp>"How is that a response to what I said?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you one of the fifteen richest men in the nation? Answer me first. Are you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, because I'm not a messed up freak."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you think when you watch ants crawl around? Do you observe a clear moral code? Or do you think ants are amoral? They regularly eat their own."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't want to act like an ant."</Pp>
<Pp>"The ant is perfect! The ant creates and the ant conquers! He is a fine-tuned engine of righteous aggression, and one *day he will consume you! You, my friend, are lazy and soggy with feeling. You're getting in your own way. It's sad to watch."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why would I ever listen to your advice? You ruined my entire life."</Pp>
<Pp>"What life? You had, what, ONE friend? A cramped, rotten cubby? Seems miserable."</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course it was miserable. Everything is miserable."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes! So why not act like an ant?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Cuz God made us humans."</Pp>
<Pp>"There's no such thing as a human. We're all ants, big fleshy ants. The sad reality is, some of us appear to have lost that determination, that intensity, given to us by God. Those people, and by that I mean the people like you, are all gonna die out. Unless, of course, you all read my book <em>The 01Stone Method</em>."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm never going to read your garbage book."</Pp>
<Pp>"Come on! It's good! I think it would teach you some really valuable lessons. I'm sincerely trying to help you right now. We got a zoip from Tulip the other *day, boo hoo hoo, may it rest in peace. It was very worried about you. It said you were using your dead name. Jim__ __Goldman."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jesus Christ. Tulip actually contacted you? He was <em>such</em> a booger."</Pp>
<Pp>"You breached our contract. Plain and simple. We're going to have to punish you."</Pp>
<Pp>"You don't decide who I am."</Pp>
<Pp>"Where is all this obstinance coming from? You're acting juvenile."</Pp>
<Pp>"Fnuck you. I hope your penis gets ripped off."</Pp>
<Pp>"What are you doing? Do you want me to kill you? I'll smash your brains out."</Pp>
<Pp>"OH MY GOD! Ha ha!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Is something funny?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, I just feel like I'm in Hell. Please let me go."</Pp>
<Pp>"I would not hesitate to smash your brains out with a hammer. I really do mean that. Got it? So shut your little rat mouth. You are nothing. You're less than nothing, you're slime. No one on this entire fnucking planet cares about you. You're a parasite, a barnacle, wasting away in front of us. A joke we can all enjoy."</Pp>
<Pp>"Bash my brains out, you weirdo. Do what you have to do. I don't know. You seem to be tangled up in this power stuff. Just keep in mind that my celly's been recording audio in my pouch this entire time. It's broadcasting this whole chittychat out as a drip."</Pp>
<Pp>"AH! Alright. That's, hmm. Please show me."</Pp>
<Pp>"This is in the public record now. People know that I'm alive, that I'm innocent, everything. Let me leave. I just want to go home."</Pp>
<Pp>"Prove it. Show me your celly."</Pp>
<Pp>"But it's in my pouch."</Pp>
<Pp>"Then remove it from your pouch. Now."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. OK. H-here, let me get it out. One *second. Oh...Darn. The battery must have just died. It broadcasted everything up until now though."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wouldn't there be an alert on my deskscreen? My Drip account is sipped onto yours."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh. Hmm. Drip must be having some server outages."</Pp>
<Pp>A throat clears behind me.</Pp>
<Pp>"This is the end of our conversation, Bunndy22. I don't appreciate your attempt to trick me. You need to learn how to behave."</Pp>
<Pp>Huge clammy palm rubs against my neck. The fingers push into my hair.</Pp>
<Pp>"I will pray for you."</Pp>
<Pp>They clench and yank me upwards by the skull. My neck stings taut like it's going to rip. Grabbus grunts and thrusts me headfirst down into the shag carpet. The grey fibers aren't nearly plush enough to cushion my descent. My nose crunches and the thudding crack of skeleton against concrete is almost pronounceable. My front teeth crunch. Blood gushes into my field of vision. I gag on something in the throat before I'm yanked up by my hair once more, and smashed once more against the ground, feeling my face give way, erupting, warm onto myself enough to melt the vision into void.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>When I saw light again I was floating. I dragged my arms through brackish lukewarm magenta goo which smelled like powdered cumin. I was floating in a circular pool full of it. Pretty big pool. The fluid was about up to my nipples. My feet touched the ground. The interior stone walls of the pool stretched upward, I craned my neck back but it hurt. Far up on the outside rim a man gazed down at me. His smile was beaming and his face skin was sagging like it was melted. I couldn't seem to find a ladder up and out. I felt very exposed. I couldn't remember most of my fundamental knowledge. They must've disconnected my mindchip from my brain vein. I was wearing this thick white smock. It was heavy, must have sucked up a lot of the magenta fluid. Besides the smock I was nude.</Pp>
<Pp>I projected my voice. "Excuse me mister! Excuse me! Can you hear me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Why yes I can. Nice to meet you. My name is Wyshwald52 45Brempf."</Pp>
<Pp>"Where am I?"</Pp>
<Pp>"My my. What a terrific question."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you answer it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Why yes I can indeed. You are presently in the Soaking Pit."</Pp>
<Pp>"How did I get here?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes, yes. You are really knocking it out of the kronky stadium with these questions. Very good things to establish. You were brought here by one of Mr. 01Stone's men. He took a vein from the Skull all the way down here."</Pp>
<Pp>"A vein?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Aaaah, yes. Sorry my deepest apologies. I mean a 'slide.' I should not have used that terminology."</Pp>
<Pp>"Is there a ladder I can use to climb out of here?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sadly no, there is not one that you can use."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's going on? I don't remember anything. I don't remember this smock at all. Did you take off all of my clothes? In order to get me in this smock?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Good heavens! How disgraceful! I would never. No, in fact a very sanitary machine removed your garments."</Pp>
<Pp>"But where'd it put my garments? Give me back my clothes!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I cannot tell you yet. So sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"Come on! Oh my God! This is making me feel insane!"</Pp>
<Pp>"My most deepest apologies, but you will not have your garments back until you behave."</Pp>
<Pp>"I am behaving!"</Pp>
<Pp>"No offense intended sir but I think I know quite a lot more about behavior than you do."</Pp>
<Pp>"How can you know more about 'behavior'? Everything that ever happens is a behavior."</Pp>
<Pp>"Splendid. My only request is that from now on you please refrain from erroneously challenging my expert conclusions. OK? Does that work for you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"How am I not behaving? What have I ever done wrong? I'm a man with good intentions! I have a funny sense of humor and a vibrant inner world. Please let me go home!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I resent that I have to say this but, sadly, you will not exit the pit until you behave."</Pp>
<Pp>"What is this fnucking goo? I feel sooo gross!! Oh my God!"</Pp>
<Pp>"It's a special marinade. The King's favorite recipe."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you PLEASE explain to me who this 'King' is?"</Pp>
<Pp>"He is so huge. Just enormous."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wh-why is he big?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Because a King must be big. In addition, his skin is slimy and mauve. His lips are so rubbery and wet, and they're so big that he barely has space to store them anywhere. He lives deep underground, takes a really long elevator ride to get down there. I have to bring his breakfast down every morning. He feasts on a large bag of gold, and then he pushes a healthy volume of putty into his very gigantic diaper. He--"</Pp>
<Pp>"Is this a prank teevee show or something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry sir, but this is the absolute most realistic reality."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jesus...um, and, why am I in The King's sauce?"</Pp>
<Pp>"If you cannot behave, you will serve as The King's afternoon treat."</Pp>
<Pp>"I AM BEHAVING! I HAVE ALWAYS BEHAVED! PLEASE! OH MY GOD!!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm willing to compromise."</Pp>
<Pp>"I DON'T WANT TO BE EATEN! PLEASE!! Get me out of here!!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I believe I can meet you in the middle. How does that sound?"</Pp>
<Pp>"PLEASE...sir...Jesus, holy fnuck. Oh my God."</Pp>
<Pp>"If what you have said is true, and you have always behaved, then I will revise the bylaws of this seminar. Henceforth, according to the 19th clause of the King Needs Delicious Snack (Human) statute in the Dimples national legislature, you are the King's yummy lunch until you <em>continue</em> to behave. Did you notice the subtle alteration? I added the word 'continue,' in homage to your previous behaving."</Pp>
<Pp>"Uh. Yes."</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you appreciate that? Is that more or less what you wanted?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No. Because it makes no sense."</Pp>
<Pp>"Would you care to elaborate?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Nothing makes sense. This is just complete nightmare nonsense."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well, yes, I actually think that might be true."</Pp>
<Pp>Eventually I grew tired of pleading. My demands yielded answers to questions I didn't ask which lea to questions without answers, round and round, super stupid and tedious. I wanted to rip my hair out or scoop my eyeballs out and I just ran in circles round the pool until my legs crumpled. When that happened I just floated for awhile.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm using the past tenses because my mind chip got unplugged at some point, so this is all from biomemory. It can be hard to keep all the details straight. Bear with me.</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you want me to teach you how to behave?"</Pp>
<Pp>I looked up. Wyshwald52 was still gazing down at me. He didn't blink much. I stood up tiptoes in the water.</Pp>
<Pp>"Please! I just want to go home!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you ready for your first behavior?"</Pp>
<Pp>"OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"In order to behave, you must suck your own toes."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think I can do that. My legs aren't that bendy."</Pp>
<Pp>"You must behave!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm being honest! I would totally suck my own toes if I could."</Pp>
<Pp>"Have you ever been in another creature's belly? Besides your mother's?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What kind of question is that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You ever burn in the tummy acid? Get digested into nutrients? I don't think it would feel very good, Mr. 35Fludge."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're being fnucked up. Why are you so disgusting? I hate the way your face sags down like a ballsack."</Pp>
<Pp>"That is a highly immature comment to make."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't get why I have to suck my toes. What's the point. I can't even do it. My body doesn't work like that. I'm tired and hungry. How long have I been here?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You won't know what time it is until you continue to behave."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm hungry! I feel weak!"</Pp>
<Pp>"You are permitted to drink the marinade."</Pp>
<Pp>"No! It's so salty! Give me food!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you ready for your second behavior?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What is it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Describe to me the sensations of how it would feel to kill your own best friend."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why is that a good 'behavior'? You're jacked up in the head."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do it. If you don't do it you're a moron."</Pp>
<Pp>"NO! Fnuck! I hate you!"</Pp>
<Pp>"These two behaviors were designed to test your understanding of the first two precepts of The 01Stone Method."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm never going to read that book."</Pp>
<Pp>"Precept 1 is 'Embrace Indignity.' Precept 2 is 'Abandon Sympathy.' You scored very poorly on each. Such a shame."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're not even giving me a chance. I feel like I'm at the mercy of some vicious, unknowable apparatus. I don't understand."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you want to know the rest of the precepts?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sure, might as well."</Pp>
<Pp>"Precept 3 is 'Savor Indulgence.' Precept 4 is 'Achieve Torment.' Precept 5 is 'Trust Death.' If you can pass the final three behavioral exams, you'll just barely make the grade at a 60% success rate."</Pp>
<Pp>"And then I can go home?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. Are you ready to Savor Indulgence?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I guess so."</Pp>
<Pp>Something plunked into the magenta goo. A sausage rose up to the surface.</Pp>
<Pp>"Eat this frankfurter without chewing."</Pp>
<Pp>I shoved it into my piehole. The taste was savory and greasy. I mushed it around with my tongue. My tongue didn't have much space, because the frankfurter was quite large. It had a great flavor, very peppery. My belly felt so empty.</Pp>
<Pp>"Hah doo I shwallow? Wivout hooing? Doo big."</Pp>
<Pp>"You have to swallow it."</Pp>
<Pp>"DOO BIG!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Behave!"</Pp>
<Pp>"CANTH...DOO...BIG..."</Pp>
<Pp>"You are an URCHIN! Swallow!"</Pp>
<Pp>My throat constricted around the Indulgence. It lodged into my windpipe. I tried to cough or heave but I couldn't. The pressure built in my lungs and my vision got blurry. I squeezed my neck frantically in hopes I could squeeze it out or something. Everything went black and I stopped falling.</Pp>
<Pp>When I woke up I was still standing in the pool again. I felt woozy and numb. The room had been much brighter. I was nervous in the shadows. I felt my neck and there were spiky stitches running up and down my throat.</Pp>
<Pp>"What's up with my throat?"</Pp>
<Pp>Wyshwald52: "I performed an emergency tracheotomy to keep you alive."</Pp>
<Pp>"Thanks."</Pp>
<Pp>"The King prefers his snacks fresh, and not dead."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's the next behavior? What do you need me to do?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You failed miserably at Savoring Indulgence. There is no way you could pass the exam with your current score."</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you serious? I swallowed it! How does that not count?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Not fully! Nope! Sorry, you did not swallow it fully. It did not make it all the way down your throat."</Pp>
<Pp>"Go fnuck yourself! You are insane! GET ME OUT OF HERE! PLEASE!!!"</Pp>
<Pp>"From now on, focus on making yourself as delicious as possible. Think scrumptious thoughts. In addition, are you wearing any metal, jewelry for instance? The King hates the taste of metal that isn't pure gold."</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't let him eat me. I'm begging you. I have three birds back in my cubby. They're probably so worried. I don't want them to starve. Please just let me go, I need to be back home, I need to, I need to go, oh my God, oh my GOD oh my goodness, oh my God..."</Pp>
<Pp>"I really do pity your situation. But the rules are the rules for reasonable reasons."</Pp>
<Pp>"I just made putty."</Pp>
<Pp>"What?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I said I just made putty. Out of my rear."</Pp>
<Pp>"Where did it go?"</Pp>
<Pp>I pointed at the brown blobs floating next to me.</Pp>
<Pp>"You disgusting rat. You just HAD to do it in the marinade. The King absolutely hates the taste of feces. This is a complete disaster."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. I'm so scared."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well I'll have to go down there and scoop it then. Let me go get my scooper. Don't let it float anywhere else. I'm serious."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, OK. I won't."</Pp>
<Pp>He hurled a rope ladder over the wall and began his descent, gripping a miniature shovel in his big left glove. I stood perfectly still. He scurried down the ladder pretty fast. His saggy face dipped into the marinade. His watery eyes stared up at me before they focused in on my man mud island. My body went completely tense. He smelled much stinkier than I expected, even worse than my putty. He slid his shovel into the sauce below that brown log.</Pp>
<Pp> "This is just beyond depraved. Not in the marinade. What sort of person would--"</Pp>
<Pp>I smashed my knuckles into the back of his skull, he screamed, I shoved his head down into the fluid. He thrashed desperately, my muscles were hot coils igniting my limbs into furious motion. I kicked him as hard as I could and cracked my elbow against his neck vertebrae which I could feel snap crackling. His hair felt silky in my hands, I ripped some of it out. His rubbery torso wriggled and squirmed. I sunk my teeth into the back of his neck. Red warmth and the taste of iron. I kept gnawing and ripping as it gushed. I bit through tendons and veins, the cables and wiring, until his screams became whimpers. I licked my tongue deep into the wound and I dragged him by the hair up against the wall and bashed his skull against the concrete. Over and over, OVER and OVER, until the bone crunkled and out dripped some stinky grey sponge, and the blood dried beneath your fingernails and skin stuck between your teeth, you ripped out what was in there, all of him, even from long ago, birthdays, sunny vacations, notes in the lunchbox from mom, the first jokes he heard, the first songs he sung, the archived reflections of everyone he knew and anyone he could be, as stranger, friend, or family. Every perfect moment of joy and kindness and loving warmth he enjoyed crumbling grey between your fingers to drip drop into the salty slime, sploosh!</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I climbed the rope ladder as soon as I finished throwing up. I managed to squeeze Wyshwald52's fnucked up body out of his outfit. His wounds looked awful, like gooshburger meat. Everything smelled really weird too. I tried to lift his corpse up by its head but his neck skin was so pappery thin that his whole neck and head ripped straight off of his shoulders. I couldn't carry him up the ladder but I could carry his clothes. I had to leave his nude dismembered parts soaking in the crappy pit.</Pp>
<Pp>The space around the lip of the pit was very bare: a few white plastic tables, unpainted drywall, unpainted cement. I set my clothes down and scanned the room. I found a sack with all my clothes and valuables along with a sack of frankfurters. I sat on the ground and scarfed down the frankfurters like a slobbery monster. My throat hurt when I swallowed, I could feel the stitches stretch.</Pp>
<Pp>The hallways were very dimly lit. I walked in my dripping smock dragging his soggy clothes leaving red magenta streaks behind me. I listened for footsteps, but it was silent.</Pp>
<Pp>Around a corner I managed to find a restroom. I carefully walked a path around the dimly lit floor putties to the chemical sink, where I washed Wyshwald52's strap jacket and pokey pants. Most of the blood came out. I looked at my reflection in the mirror. In retrospect, I'm hoping it didn't have a ReflectionCam. But I just hadn't seen myself in a while, you know? The clothes fit me pretty well. The sleeves were a little poofy around my arms. My face looked outrageous. My skin was reddish purple. My cheeks were concave. My forehead and chin were covered in cracks and dents. I was missing a nose, it must have gotten crushed completely flat. I looked like a horrible goblin. I left my bloody smock crumpled up in the trash.</Pp>
<Pp>I walked down another hallway, took a right, then another right. Just some locked doors and an empty closet.</Pp>
<Pp>I backtracked and took a left instead. Behind a door on my left I found a place I could charge my celly. I hooked into my celly's UDP port and reactivated my mindchip. I sat and recapped everything into this log for about fifteen *minutes, the whole time until right now. This is right now!</Pp>
<Pp>I'm doing my best to stay focused and present. I don't know where I am. I just escaped execution. They're going to look for me soon. When I think about the bad things my whole body just clenches up and I belch. I'm really dizzy. I just saw a guy's guts, I think it's normal to feel weird after that. I just saw a guy's GUTS. I can't get it out of my mind. I smashed his brain out of his skull.</Pp>
<Pp>Do you feel strange about how much of a piglet I am? I really want the honest truth. It's killing me, not knowing what you think. I get it if you just think I'm slime. You must think I'm a total creep. It feels like I'm performing for you, you're my constant audience, following me everywhere I go. So listen to me right now, OK? I don't want this. Absolutely none of it. I have been sinned against. I am a victim. This is all wrong. You know how freaking nice I am, right? It was him or me. I've tried to be as much of a documentarian as possible. But I don't know if I'm going to be able to get out of here. I don't know where I am! I don't even know where I'm going. And even if I could get out of here, I don't have a speedster. I'm seriously stuck.</Pp>

<Pp>Those are the only two passcodes I ever use. I swear I typed them in correctly. I'm worried that someone in data management might've locked my zoip profile, as part of my resculpting, since it's under my actual name. That means I might not have Drip access either, since that was synced to my zoip profile. Those are probably my two favorite programs! This sucks.</Pp>
<Pp>If I can find a computerior somewhere around here maybe I can at least hook in and communicate with Deward. Deward is miserable in almost every aspect, but it does know a lot of really detailed maps, and I have no idea where I am. I'm worried about walking back into the hallway. What if someone's around the corner? I still smell like marinade and my face looks like scrambled yolks, browned over with scabs, rippled and cracking around muscle. I wonder if there's some way I could wear a mask or ease my stench. It's cold down here. I feel very worried.</Pp>
<Pp>I work up the guts to creep back out into the hallway. My boots are sticky against the floor, squishing splish splosh sounds. I feel the way I feel when I'm about to get a headache. I'm sorry for complaining so much. I feel like a dumb stupid freak.</Pp>
<Pp>On my left there's a cramped room packed with tall stacks of dusty data discs. There are so many of them. I'm trying to get some context but it seems like none of these are labeled. So they're basically garbage. No one's ever going to waste the time to sort through em.</Pp>
<Pp>Diagonal across from that room is a small kitchen. The fridge is pretty well-stocked. I grab a Bblackberry Guaava Queam, a handful of pork knobs, and a bag of frusted corn nuggets, all of which I stuff into the voluminous pockets of my pokey pants. These are really weird pants for a person to wear. What was up with this Wyshwald52 guy? Who did I just kill?</Pp>
<Pp>Around the corner I find what looks to be the man I just killed's computerior room. He has a really big Ultradef, looks like a comfortable keypad too. His account's still signed in. His foam desk chair is miserably sunken in and appears to be deeply stained by many varieties of natural body oils. It feels just slightly damp to sit in. I pull up the console. He seems to have a conversation going with Deward.</Pp>

<Pp>TO DO: Put graphical map in here.</Pp>
<Pp>I wish I had time to look through Wyshwald52's files, I bet they're interesting. I really wonder how anyone on planet earth could ever be Deward's "BUDDY." I'm sure Deward got super frustrated when I neglected to ask how its *day was. That's the kind of stuff that makes it flip out.</Pp>
<Pp>According to the cartographic "YOU ARE HERE" label, I'm on the west end of basement 3. I'm thinking I'll stop by the Resident Chamber on my way down the eastward corridor. Maybe I can find something to cover my face in there. There's a staircase at the end of that corridor that curls up into an amorphous room marked "Exploratory Bio Combs," whatever that means. If this map is up to date, there's a Slide Room at the end of those EBCs. I should be able to take a slide all the way up to The Neck. Fingers crossed that Jumper56 is still in her pod. She'll drive me home. That's what I'm banking on. She's a nice person.</Pp>
<Pp>I strut down the hall on my tip toes. My little mind is on an elliptical rampage I can't transcribe. My muscles are burning and my belly is aching. I keep hearing little clicks and buzzes in the distance. My eyes are blurry. My heart is about to burst out of my ribcage. I think I'm in shock right now. That's probably why things feel muffled. I'm still doing pretty well all things considered. You don't have to worry about me, I'm doing fine.</Pp>
<Pp>This must be Wyshwald52's Resident Chamber. There are strap jackets and pairs of pokey pants hanging in the closet, just like the ones I'm wearing, but in so many patterns and colors. Plus it smells like him, that particular musty scent. The floral wallpapper is yellowy and peeling, the carpet is gritty like it hasn't been vacuumed in *decades. I don't want to spend a lot of time here, so I prioritize by searching through his dresser first. Perhaps he had goggles, or a mask, or maybe even a balaclava. Anything to change the way my face looks, throw off whatever surveillance algorithms they use for analyzing faces that show up on camera streams.</Pp>
<Pp>Because at this point I'm sure I spend every *second of my life in the frame of a lens. Machines have been tracking me since I was a baby. That's reality. That's how it's always been for forever, but I've never done something bad enough for that to be an especially important concern. They know everything about me. The digital records of all my motives, desires, thoughts, and purchases will persist in dusty server farms </em>centuries after I take my final breath. All that raw data, more than half of the words I've ever spoken, is currently owned by a loose confederacy of corporations. They know so much about what I'm doing and where I'll be on any given *day. I've seen the information we collect here at Dimples. Every packet is tagged with a georeference. They could easily plug in my coordinates and reduce me to guts with their long outer space guns. I realize I probably sound like a mental freak but I'm being serious.</Pp>
<Pp>It's starting to seem like Wyshwald52 doesn't own many actual items or tools. He mostly just has stuffed plushy animal toys. They're kind of cute but it's still pretty weird. Like, who would want this big stuffed alligator past the age of, like, 4? It's really heavy, uncomfortable to hold. It's not even adorable or anything. Its smile is very unrealistic. Yuck. He also has some froggies and a ducky and a bunny. Those are fine I guess. I just don't like that they're a dead guy's toys, I don't want to touch them. He has large jugs of powerful soap, you can tell by the color of the label, it's dark red. He has odd fluffy wigs. He has half-empty tubes of wart ointment and rash cream. Underneath the tubes, he has a Dimples FaceFriend. I guess I should be using the past tense, he <em>had </em>a Dimples FaceFriend. He can't claim ownership when his dead body is bleeding out in a pit of dark sauce.</Pp>
<Pp>I plug the FaceFriend into the wall socket and it whirrs to life. This must be an earlier model, it's taking much longer to boot up and its visual design is notably less slick. The human face-shaped indentation sinks into the side of the machine. I scroll through the face options on the touch screen. They all honestly look pretty good. But I don't want to stick out, so I select the most basic default facial arrangement ratios available.</Pp>
<Pp>The foamy indentation gargles. I carefully slide my face in.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I step through a vortex door into the "Exploratory Bio Combs." The space is lofty and expansive. It's very crowded, like they're having some kind of convention. Men of all kinds walk around each other in opposing directions. There are no women in sight. The men are all wearing white robes that billow with movement. Their hair is gelled. Their cheerful faces capture a calm, dutiful focus. They say "whoops," "sorry," "excuse me" as they scoot past one another. No one's even glanced in my direction.</Pp>
<Pp>My brand new face still hurts really bad in every way, but it's at least more sculpted, less smashed. From the front my face is perfectly circular, and from a sideways angle my head is honestly kind of thin compared to its perimeter. Also, the machine completely flattened my features. The only bumps are my eyes, mouth, and nose. So basically my head looks like a very large fleshy ancient coin. I'm no longer conventionally attractive, but I'm sure to attract less attention. At least my senses are intact. The process didn't even hurt that bad. My facial bones and cartilage are pretty squishy and malleable at this point. Now that I've gone through two rearrangements they're easy to mush around like creamed corn.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm not sure how to slip into the foot traffic. Men are walking from Bio Comb to Bio Comb, peering inside and grinning. The Combs are hulking round cream-colored structures with circular windows, sort of like the kind they use to show off the animals at Critter Dome. Robed men immediately start bumping into me as I step into the current: "darn," "much apologies," "scuse me coming through." A long haired man on my left steps in front of me and I follow him. I use his swinging blond dual ponytails as beacons in the noise. I follow him to what appears to be labelled BIO COMB #272.</Pp>
<Pp>The exhibit is a bare white room filled with nude deformed humans. These unfortunate souls have four arms instead of two arms and two legs. They wriggle on their bellies and seem to execute many tasks at once; one arm answers the phone, another arm uses a suite of office management programs on a computerior, a lower arm assists with eating meat or chugging Queam, and the remaining arm grabs any putties that fall out of their naked rear. There is a lot of putty smeared all over the place. Some pre-recorded audio plays over the speaker system. The voice is brash and confident.</Pp>
<Pp>"BIO COMB #272 is an attempt to engineer a completely distributed, asynchronous clone worker. Our batch of 272s make for very peppy, efficient employees. These little freaks do everything at once, so they have no need for costly breaks! However, they do demand regular maintenance of urinary and fecal materials, as diaper rash is a top concern. Supervision is also a must, as there have been numerous cases of 272s malfunctioning and ripping their own eyes out."</Pp>
<Pp>A drooling four-armed worker with a buzzcut thrashes on the floor. The slobber dribbles down his chin and dries into his crusty goatee. His many elbows are smeared in putty. His eyes are moist and red. He must be so tired. Some of the robed men around me lightly applaud, others perform a graceful bow.</Pp>
<Pp>My stomach twists into knots. My blond ponytailed beacon is nowhere in sight. I push through the human swarm, headed toward the other end of the corridor. The chittering of polite masculine cadences ring in the space behind my eyes.</Pp>
<Pp> I pass by BIO COMB #174 on my way out of the crowds. I can't help but look inside. The people inside aren't deformed, but they are nude. They all have the same short buzzed brown haircuts and skinny bony bodies. In fact they all look just like Rony22 95Barnard, that one guy who worked under my pod. Remember him?</Pp>
<Pp>"BIO COMB #174 contains Manager 2, a brand new batch of one of our best-selling clones. Let's be honest: this guy is scrawny and weak. This guy is not gonna live very long. This guy is very vulnerable to viral infection. But what makes the Manager 2 special is his complete lack of any ego or defining characteristics. He is a blank slate. He exists to please. He is so, so hungry for a purpose. He is so ready to execute tasks of any kind. Let him make you proud!"</Pp>
<Pp>The Manager 2s trample around their enclosure on all fours. They're like a feral herd of 100+ identical siblings. Their tongues droop out. They climb on each other's heads and lick the window ravenously. Their brown eyes are wide and bulging. So much skin and muscle rubs against the window. I can't hear them but I can tell how often they're screaming. They scrape each other's backs and chew each other's ears and stomp each other's faces into the moist human waste. This is the most sick perversion I have ever witnessed.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I drag myself to the slide room. I hop in the slide that loops all the way up to the Neck. I don't have time for describing.</Pp>
<Pp>I'm trying really hard to process things. I know God must've had a reason for this. He has so many awesome reasons for everything, but they're just really weird reasons, and we're never going to figure them out. He's playing the long game...testing our faith...trying to trick us, but in a benevolent, weird way. I suspect he's just that much of a mastermind.</Pp>
<Pp>He knew I was going to do everything I've ever done. I'd like to believe there's some greater truth to be gleaned from analysis of any discrete occurrence, but I can't discern any underlying moral. I don't think I can make it make sense. I'd been rationalizing the two people who died on account of the big crash as victims of a greater system. Faceless casualties, I'd never have to meet them. I don't remember their names. Their deaths weren't even my fault anyway. But I killed this guy with my hands and now I'm wearing his clothes. The Bible definitely says you're not allowed to do that. Even if it was self defense, I think I lose the benefit of the doubt the second time around. I'm starting to wonder whether I'm the problem.</Pp>
<Pp>I step out onto the fifth floor. According to the windows it's dark red outside. I must've forgotten that it's evening. It feels pretty weird to walk past my workpod. Some other guy's using it. He's got his programming gloves on, UDP connected, totally in the mode. By the looks of it he seems like a nerd, no offense. Jumper56's pod is just around the corner.</Pp>
<Pp>I knock on the door: "Hey."</Pp>
<Pp>She jolts up in surprise.</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh! Ca-can I help you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It's me. Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"Really?" She squints her eyes. "God. Oh my GOD! You look so much worse every time."</Pp>
<Pp>"I crashed my speedster. A lot of other bad things happened too. None of this is my fault. I don't have any time for describing. Can you please drive me home?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Absolutely not."</Pp>
<Pp>"Please!"</Pp>
<Pp>"You don't sincerely believe in my humanity."</Pp>
<Pp>"You don't understand. They're going to kill me. They're going to feed me to a giant monster!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you having an episode or something? Have you been taking your daily suppies?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Stop it! I'm being serious!! And I guess technically I haven't been taking my suppies."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why haven't you been taking them?"</Pp>
<Pp>"They trapped me. I had no access to them. Stop looking at me like that!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Can't you get anyone else to drive you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No one else. I'm begging you."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wow. You really are such a remarkably wretched human being. You can't think of a single person who would give you a ride home?"</Pp>
<Pp>"That's not fair. I had a lot of friends at Knowledge Dome. They just moved away."</Pp>
<Pp>"You mean they moved away, what, five *years ago? And you haven't made one single friend since?" Her eyes look very sharp. "Am I seriously your only friend?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Why are you being so hard on me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Because you're a bad person, Jim29! You've ended freaking lives! Why can't you get that through your fnucking head?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I never caused that bug. I swear. I was framed."</Pp>
<Pp>Jumper56 laughs with a volume that seems performative. "Why should I ever believe you? Also, why are you still trying to get me to drive you home? Why would I ever do that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Alright fine. Here's the deal. You can have all everything I own, all my gold. I know you'll do something good with it. Just please make sure my birdies are OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm not sure I follow."</Pp>
<Pp>"The passcode for my door is CompleteDaytime111. Can you write that down?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I need you to rewind a little. What's going on?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm an agent of poison and waste, supporting the fulcrum of oppression. The soil would benefit from my absence. I'm going somewhere far away, where flowers grow."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean? You're running away because I was mean to you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm not a person. I'm a problem."</Pp>
<Pp>"Seriously buddy, you really hurt my feelings, but it's not that big of a deal. I was just mad OK?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The oceans haven't melted yet. I'm going to go North, across the ice. I need to put myself somewhere else. I am blight."</Pp>
<Pp>"You are so annoying. Sounds like a really cool dramatic exit, yah. Literally no one cares about you. You just want to escape the need to try at anything, right? The need to do anything difficult? It's a good plan. It'll work out great."</Pp>
<Pp>"Will you take care of my birdies? They're helpless. You can have all of my gold. Every single speck of it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Didn't you put those cameras in their cages? So they could let themselves out? I remember you spent like fifteen *minutes explaining me that."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah actually I did, you have a good memory. But they'd never pass the test. They have no sense of ego."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh of course. Sure."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you promise you'll take care of em?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I guess if I have to. You're sort of forcing it on me."</Pp>
<Pp>"Goodbye, Jumper56."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wait, are you like, going to kill yourself?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No. I'm going to walk to to the northern coast and try to cross the frozen ocean."</Pp>
<Pp>"I wasn't sure exactly how literal you were being."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"You think there's something on the other side?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Shouldn't there be?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't know man. I don't know about this. If I agree to take care of your birds, you'll give me literally all your gold?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. I promise."</Pp>
<Pp>"I can give you a ride then. The north coast is pretty far away."</Pp>
<Pp>"Really? Awesome. Tight."</Pp>
<Pp>"Your whole idea is bizarre and makes no sense, but I have no gold, so it'd be sorta stupid to turn you down. I can at least make sure you don't get eaten alive along the way, lost in some Tier 4 golgotha."</Pp>
<Pp>"Phew. I really do appreciate it. This has been the worst *day of my life."</Pp>
<Pp>"Mhm."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wait, shoot, are you still struggling with that bug? Am I distracting you from that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No I fixed it this morning. I didn't need your help."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh OK. Very cool, nice."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>My stomach lurches as I slip down the slide first floorward. The walls of the slide are so squeaky and soft. I squelch through a zigzag drop. The angular velocity makes me feel like a kronky ball. I close my eyes and do my best to not imagine busted brains. I zoom around a tight bend. I'm picking up a lot of speed so I rub my palms against the sides of the slide. My skin's friction makes slappy noise, prappa prap prap. I slowly skid toward the first floor slide's exit mouth.</Pp>
<Pp>[ This part might be stupid, trying to figure out what to do here ]</Pp>
<Pp>A thin slice of the epithelial chute hungrily juts inward around my neck and blocks my head, clenching me significantly. I writhe and thrash. The pressure is mashing my throat in. I can kick my feet out of the mouth of the slide. I struggle to find air left in my lungs.</Pp>
<Pp>[coloring to indicate Deward text]</Pp>
<Pp>Bunndy22 you are a WORM I am going to snap yuou IN HALF</Pp>
<Pp>WYSHWALD52 was my and also my BUDDY</Pp>
<Pp>Vision goes purple. Skull rumbles with my croaking gags.</Pp>
<Pp>Let me CRUCNH you the baby bababy TADPOLE</Pp>
<Pp>GREAT indeedy GREAT GREAT indeedy indeedy</Pp>
<Pp>I feel small hands wrap around my feet. Yanking. Pressure on my neck it's unbearable. Rubbery material sucking my neck off my shoulders. Biting deep into my tongue.</Pp>
<Pp>Yes yyes I will SLURP you into HELL</Pp>
<Pp>Head drips through the hole and I pop out flying horizontal. Skull and rear bounce against the hard plastic. I'm just inhaling air for a *sec. Jumper56 looks down at me. She looks bored. She turns to walk away.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>Jumper56's speedster is named Louisa. Louisa has long eyelashes and a little button nose. It greets Jumper56. "Whee! Good afternoon! I hope your *day was like a plastic bag full of sunshine."</Pp>
<Pp>What a sweet and courteous speedster. I wonder if they have a good relationship. My thoughts drift to Tulip. I feel pangs of guilt. He betrayed me, but I still miss him. He didn't deserve to suffer the way he did. I hope he's found peace.</Pp>
<Pp>Jumper56 clicks in and twists her thumb in the ignition socket. Louisa's engine roars to life. A soft overhead light warms into a glow. We pull out of the parking notch. She looks over at me with faraway eyes. "It doesn't seem like you have like, the essentials. For going on a trip I mean. Are you sure you don't want me to take you home first?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No. I don't have time for that."</Pp>
<Pp>"You don't wanna see your birds one last time??"</Pp>
<Pp>"It wouldn't be safe."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK be honest, did you do something illegal? Is it illegal for me to be helpin you right now?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, you're fine. It's chill."</Pp>
<Pp>"If I get arrested they'll kick me down a tier. You realize that, right?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. There's nothing to worry about. Just take me north. Then you get <em>all</em> my gold."</Pp>
<Pp>We turn onto Smile Avenue, the northeastern Dimples exit path. She rolls to a stop before the red light. "It's sort of icky how you keep saying that, '<em>all</em> my gold.' I don't like whatever power dynamic is developing."</Pp>
<Pp>"What? I was just acknowledging the incentive. I want everything to work out."</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't act like you're giving away your gold as some benevolent gesture out of pity. You're doing that because you have like, no other choice. Because I'm the only person left in Nowhere Else who would ever even CONSIDER helping you in an emergency. That's weird."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry. I didn't mean to come across that way."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's fine. You mind if I play some tunes? The drive takes about an *hour or so."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sure, as long as they're not scary."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean 'scary'?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You were playing some pretty ghoulish stuff at your party."</Pp>
<Pp>"Ha ha that scared you? That was just some fun dance music."</Pp>
<Pp>"I thought it was simply horrendous. Such a worrisome array of nightmarish noises."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jesus, OK, I'll play something more mellow."</Pp>
<Pp>The sounds are like neon dots warping in distant vision. Rainbow clouds floof between. The rhythms throb vertically. My face is so strange now. The curves are unnatural to touch. I sink into the seat. I imagine myself on the edge of the sky. I open the Bblackberry Guaava Queam, pork knobs, and frosted corn nuggets I'd stuffed in my jacket. I close my eyes and I'm on the edge of the sky again eating pork knobs, watching the networks of dots in motion, digging the pork veins out from between my teeth. The eyes of my eyes gently descend into vapor.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>"Hey dude. Wake up."</Pp>
<Pp>"Wha...hmmnnn..."</Pp>
<Pp>"I pulled over to a rest station. This is as far as I go."</Pp>
<Pp>"...OK...I'm going to go back to sleep..."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jim29, I'm on my last rest token. I bought three when I got here. I'd been waiting for you to wake up for a long time."</Pp>
<Pp>"Where am I?"</Pp>
<Pp>"The northern coast? Exactly where you told me to drive?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh. Right. Yah. Can I just sit here for a *sec?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry my knucklehead. Traffic was already horrible on the way here. I'd like to get home before midnight."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm your knucklehead?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yop. At least as much as anyone else is."</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you have a lantern I could borrow? It looks pretty inky out there."</Pp>
<Pp>"No, I don't have a lantern you can drag across the ocean."</Pp>
<Pp>"Alright. That's very sensible. I appreciate your assistance."</Pp>
<Pp>"No problem. Also what's your door code again? And is there anything special you need me to do for your birds?"</Pp>
<Pp>"111CompleteDaytime. Tell them I miss them so much."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. Just ran out of tokens. Gotta go."</Pp>
<Pp>"Goodbye Jumper56."</Pp>
<Pp>"Goodbye Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"Maybe I'll see you again someday."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh my God though! I really hope not."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hm. I regret leaving you with a bad impression."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah dude, ha ha. You're definitely going straight to Hell."</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I've been walking for *hours. My body wasn't built for doing such things. My feet are killing me. It's dark and slippery and windy. I'm using my celly's screen as a makeshift lantern, lighting the way forward. It might die soon. Feels like I've been using it for a dam while. I don't get celly service out here so the NiceTime stopped updating. It's impossible to know how long it's been.</Pp>
<Pp>It's impossible to know anything at all! Am I even going anywhere? How can I be sure I even left? Can I be sure it'll stop being dark? Is there anything more I could have done? Why do I keep making myself more alone? What am I to myself without others for comparison? Modern life is bathing alone in the lather of everyday people's accomplishments. What have I ever done in isolation? I'm starving for contact or engagement. Have I ever once, in my entire life, been anything but an extremely boring fraud with an above-average vocabulary? As I crumple up and die five hundred *years from now, will I be disappointed in myself?</Pp>
<Pp>How do I know I exist? How do I know you exist? How are you reading this? Are you hearing this instead? I know this is one-way archived communication, but what do you think of me? I'm sure I'll never know. I bet you're weighing the nuances of my perspective and evaluating my thoughts in totally good faith. I'm a nice guy, aren't I? Ha ha. For all you know, I could be making all this up!! I'm not though, I promise. I've been doing my best to be very honest and vulnerable. I can only say what I believe. It's comforting to lean on a consistent logical architecture for support against the crashing waves of indecision and doubt. I think I'm closed-minded. My mind doesn't have space for anything right now, it's full of worries and ephemeral trash entertainment. Feels like hubris to say I know how anything really truly is or isn't or whatever. Sorry. This is dumb.</Pp>
<Pp>What I do know is that I'm walking on the ice. I've got expensive boots so it's not very slippery. The planet's breath buffets my face. I have to stare down at the ground to anticipate my optimal foot placement points. My celly's brightness is down so I have just barely enough light to make out the cracks and dips in the floe. Some puddles have accumulated on the surface but I'm pretty sure it's normal for frozen ice to have puddles. Puddles aren't anything to worry about.</Pp>
<Pp>Deep within the innermost nut of my mind I can hear shimmering voices, see blurry faces, feel the warm color from before. I was sort of lying when I said that it's not very slippery. It's definitely really slippery, and I'm trying hard not to fall over. I channel positive and nice thoughts in order to smile. There's love left in me. My legs are wobbly and my feet ache. I stop walking.</Pp>
<Pp>This part of the night sky isn't cloudy. Instead you can see bright little dots between the dark. Look at that! They're glowing twinkly white. I know they're stars, I've heard about them before. The literary synopses I had to skim at Knowledge Dome mentioned them a lot. They look exactly how I expected they would. I can't say I'm all that impressed.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I have formulated a brand new theory. This theory is simple, yet surprisingly truthful. It is thus: every conflict is a result of misplacement. All suffering is just poor organization. Everything has its natural place, and we did a terrible job rearranging. We exist in contention with nature, with each other, with God, with ourselves. Gold should be in the hands of the needy, love should be in our minds, food should be in the hands of the hungry, carcinogens shouldn't be in the corn or the water, no one should have guns, coal should've stayed in the ground.</Pp>
<Pp>I know my Birth Rate/Death Rate facts, and I've seen samples of the data we collected at Dimples. More than a billion people die of cancer every *year. Another four billion die of dementia.The infant mortality rate is 7%. *yearly homicides doubled over the last *decade, and the incidents are particularly concentrated in regions ravaged by natural disasters. Speaking of disasters, I'm not even counting the people displaced or extinguished by a treacherous climate or endless war. The average citizen in Nowhere Else experiences bottomless hardship in eyesight of extravagant splendor. I feel nauseous when I consider that seriously.</Pp>
<Pp>What I suppose I mean is if everything has its natural place, then things could theoretically work fine. I could find my natural place where things work fine, and I could need to exist. Somewhere I'm needed desperately. I could feel permanently satisfied there. It would all be organized and nothing would ever have to feel confusing.</Pp>
<Pp>I know I'll never meet Jesus. He and God are very bored of me. That must be the deal at this point. They're blowing me off because they think I'm a weirdo. I get it. There are better ways they can use their time, which is why I'm constraining my wonders to the terrestrial. But even that feels pointless. One of these *years we'll all get wiped out. That's basically a given. This won't exist for too much longer. Something's going to come to a head, or something's going to swoop in. The lights are going to turn off.</Pp>
<Pp>I hope Buzz, Boom, and Boing are sleeping well. Feathers fluffed up, little eyes closed, one foot curled up while the other balances on the branch, soft tiny chest rising and falling. I really miss them dearly. Hopefully Jumper56 takes care of them like she said she would. I'm sure she will. She's a nice person.</Pp>
<Pp>My cellular device dies. In an instant the darkness is fearsome and limitless. The puddles are up to my ankles.</Pp>
<Pp><strong>ê©í</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I awake in the fetal position with a mouth full of ocean water. The rays of dawn are brilliant and pink in the perfectly clear sky. My body feels horrendous. My head is pumping with pressure and my stomach is full of spikes. I'm feeling the withdrawal symptoms for Nervacor, Dexagent, Nutridote, and Jubimum simultaneously. I'm completely soaked. The ice floe is bobbing up and down. My guts feel like they're imploding. In the warm sun I am terrified and weak. I'm glad my mindchip still has battery. It feels good to know I can at least get this story down and tell it in my inimitable style.</Pp>
<Pp>I must've been trapped in the Soaking Pit for longer than I was aware. Otherwise I don't get why everything melted so fast. I sit up on my rear and attempt to orient myself. I'm sitting on a substantially large, gradually rotating slab of ice  How can I know which way is north? I feel nothing but panic and dread.</Pp>
<Pp>I try to stand up but it is so fricking slippery. What the hell, oh my, uh, alright, let me get my balance here. OK. I think the worst idea in this moment would be to stay right where I am. In this place my death is guaranteed. But if I go somewhere different I might be able to avoid prolong my misfortune. I think very spectacularly hard. Once I'm done thinking I choose a direction that is about 174 radians to my left. I step forth with confidence and bravery in my heart. That's the key to walking when it's slippery. I step forward once, twice, 5 times, pure confidence, 13 times, I hop onto another ice floe, 22 times, 35 times, nothing but bravery, 48 times, I kick my feet to hop onto another ice floe but my dominant foot slips out from beneath me. I flop onto the ice and the whole slab jerks downward. I slip into water. Warmth's replaced by pain. Heavy and frigid. I thrash my appendages. Cannot generate upward lift. Have air but not much. I unzip my heavy boots, kick downward, keep doing it. I crane my head up and I can barely breathe. The solid ice keeps drifting farther away. I have no hope of reaching it. I push down with all available force and lift my voice to shriek "SAVE ME GOD! NO!!!! HELP!! OHMYGOD!! JESUS!! JEEESUS!!! SAVE ME! I'M DROWNING!! I CAN'T SWIM!! GOD IN HEAVEN! CHRIST!! GOD!!! FNUCK!! OH NO!! GOD! WHAT HAVE I DONE?? WHAT DID I DO, GOD!! I NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM DON'T LET ME--<em>gurgling</em>--AAAAAHHHH!!!!! JESUS FNUCKING CHRIST--<em>gargling</em>--AAAAAIIIEEEEEE!!! NO NO NO NO NO PLEASE OHMYGOD NO DON'T DO THIS TO ME DON'T!!!" My voice is sore, I start coughing up water, my limbs are completely numb, I can't think of anything, pale dot in the pink sky, keep kicking, crane neck up again, bigger pale dot from on high, can't kick anymore, sinking, pale hand in my eye, sinking beneath, closed shut, one gulp of air then back to falling. Until I am grasped entirely and yanked upward by the enormous limb of a transparent being. I'm accelerating upwards into the sky. Its hand has a complete seal between the fingers cuz otherwise the pressure would've crushed my tiny skull. The fingers are solid like glass but with taffy colored tongues of lightning zapping around inside. Behind them I can see the ocean, the black clouds of Nowhere Else, even landforms I never knew, dropping out of sight. The planet reveals its roundness. My encasement rockets upwards. I don't know where I'm going. Everything else descends out of view. The sky turns into black. We zip by the enormous rocky moon. I'm so damp. I'm getting pruney. The clenched digits didn't form a perfect air seal, there's some water splashing around in here too. I think we just shot past Neptune, or maybe that was a different blue planet. Stomach lurches and feel like I'm about to barf. The motion hurts my eyes. I don't think we're in the solar system anymore. I fall over onto my stomach. Eyes point downward.  I spot the receding spiralling stars of a galaxy, glimmering dust of a nebula, mostly rocks. Light makes my eyes sting. I desperately bang my fists against the limits of my enclosure. I shout "BACK! TAKE ME BACK!! NO! BACK!! BACK!!!" And then I think I'm  yanked   up    out     of      the       universe.     And,    I can   see    MANY   new   colors,        if   only    I    could   show    you   them.     The  hand   opens   up      and    I      can    see    out        over       the     ultra       colored       biting         smiles       of        unfurling          flowering         spectral        simmering        mirror         teeth      slavering         curling    into    wild  coils     like   nothing   mathematic.     Ten      thousand       million     faces    with   triple   the mouths   and   noses      grin       until   they    morph    or  dissolve.    I             am           pulled         closer.       I     am       stared      right     at      into       by     this           gnashing     tissue.        I   try      to      speak   but        there's      nothing       left    for    my lungs,    no    sound     either         so     yes       I    gaggg     and      wheeeze       and     wave    for       attention     and      bathe       in      the          shine        of         its    infinite       everpresence     as    its         proud   voice        obliterates     my      hearing   mind:</Pp>
<Pp><strong>YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.</strong></Pp>
<Pp>It      looks       down   upon     me   with         tenderness</Pp>
<Pp><strong>I LOVE THE WAY YOU PLAY. ARE YOU DANCING FOR ME?</strong></Pp>
<Pp>I'm     really      just     shivering</Pp>
<Pp><strong>WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DANCE. YOU ARE A WORK OF ART.</strong></Pp>
<Pp>...</Pp>
<Pp><strong>PLEASE, SING FOR ME!</strong></Pp>
<Pp>‚ö´</Pp>
