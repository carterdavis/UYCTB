Walking up a steep hill. Flower I can't remember name of. Dr. Kindbrain tells me I'm a rotten fool. Spinning room, I'm trying to keep things from rolling. Companion from childhood's sinister glare. Temporary vision of dancing elephants, ha ha! Falling, gaining velocity. I wake up. Walk into the bathroom, push out some wizz. Return to the warm sheets and roll onto my belly. Jellybed feels especially soggy tonight. My body aches in whichever contortion. Sitting in my car again. Trying to cut my hand with safety scissors, doesn't work. Sitting in the garden atrium eating a frozen casserole.
