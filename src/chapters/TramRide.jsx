<Z d={1} u="sys">%SYS_OP% : Congratulations, BUNNDY22!</Z>
<Z d={1} u="sys">~ : Your new workpod is located on FLOOR_3, CELL_5_EAST</Z>
<Z d={1} u="sys">~ : 162 gold hunks deducted from your salary sack for this <span class="t">*</span>month,</Z>

<Pp>I'm leaning against a pole. Chadmuth48 is reclining sideways across three chairs. He hasn't said a word to me since we boarded the tram. No one else is in our carriage. The overhead fluorescent is flickering. The concrete tunnel walls outside the foggy glass windows are overgrown with fuzzy brown fungus. He's scrolling through zoips on his celly but I don't have anything to entertain myself with. With this in mind, I sigh expressively.</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48: "How's it poppin?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Hm?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You made a performative sigh, so I asked how it's poppin."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's poppin fairly OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's what I like to hear."</Pp>
<Pp>Chugging wheels roll us through the darkness.</Pp>
<Pp>I gotta ask. "Why did your wife file for a dissolution?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Ex-wife, you mean. And I still have two others."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh OK. And sorry I just realized that might be a rude question. You don't have to answer."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's not rude, only a little out of the blue. The fact is, I've always had trouble keeping wives happy. It's not something that comes naturally to me."</Pp>
<Pp>"What's difficult about it? I've never had a wife before."</Pp>
<Pp>"Well you know how I'm good-natured, funky, and free spirited?" He wiggles his hands around in a couple of kooky ways.</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"I think the reality is that I'm too good-natured, funky, and free-spirited. People can barely keep up with me, especially my wives. It's like I can't be tamed...I'm a real dynamo."</Pp>
<Pp>"Got it."</Pp>
<Pp>"My Gingerbell__ was everything to me. Or at least a third of everything, since I had three wives in total. But she was my favorite. She really rocked."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why aren't you saying her registration numbers?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't want you searching her name. You seem like you could be creepy."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gotcha. But it's OK to publish my complete name in a press release for trillions of people to read? Do you realize how many weirdos have threatened to kill me?"</Pp>
<Pp>He sits up and stares at me, eyebrows raised. He does that for a few <span class="t">*</span>seconds. Then he speaks:</Pp>
<Pp>"Gingerbell__ understood me for who I am. At least I'm pretty sure she did. I can be hard to 'get,' that's a thing I know about myself, it's like I'm a walking contradiction or an oxymoron or whatever. But there's no magic to it. I'm mechanical like anyone else, only ever working my hardest to feel as little pain as possible. This world ran out of mysteries a long time ago. She understood me, I understood her, and she was the first one to get bored. I've always had trouble making myself available, always will. Everything's set in stone, yah? There was no other way that reality could have arranged itself. I'm not even sad about it at all, especially since I have two other wives who both wear smokin hot outfits. They think I'm really cool and handsome."</Pp>
<Pp>"Hm...yah. Gotcha."</Pp>
<Pp>''We're Nowhere Else, bud. We have the highest standard of living in the entire universe. It ain't perfect but it's close. I work my bangin job all day and party all night long. I've been dancing a lot lately, been trying to move my body as much as possible. These have been my brightest <span class="t">*</span>years. Life totally cranks."</Pp>
<Pp>Our tram rolls to a stop at station B7. Its starboard entrance hatch swings open. A warm electronic voice speaks:</Pp>
<Pp>"Please enter or exit now."</Pp>
<Pp>A very tall man with a particularly cuboid skull climbs aboard. His eyes are glassy, his cheeks hollow, his hair stringy, and his skin translucent. He's dressed in a very dirty unisuit and carrying a crinkled plastic bag full of orange fluid. He's gradually trudging toward Chadmuth48's seat. He seems to be wandering.</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48 smiles wide. "You wanna know what I really like?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Making out with women. I like smooching on the lips. I've done it quite a few times, and I think it's feels amazing. I like to use my lips like a hand to grab and squeeze their lips between my lips. Really clutch them between my smackers. Ladies love my lips, apparently they feel awesome and strong. That's just what multiple women have told me. Do you kiss much, bud?"</Pp>
<Pp>It's hard for me to come up with an answer because the very tall man is looming behind his shoulder. Chadmuth48 turns around. <Snip state={state} bg="red, yellow">I kiss a lot by the way.</Snip></Pp>
<Pp>"Hey champ, there are plenty of other seats. I value my personal space."</Pp>
<Pp>Pale man grins. His voice is silky. "Let me sit on your lap."</Pp>
<Pp>"You are absolutely not allowed to do that."</Pp>
<Pp>"I have a story to tell you. Do you want to hear it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"If you take one more step forward I'm going to blow your fnucking head off."</Pp>
<Pp>Me: "Whoa, whoa, Chadmuth--"</Pp>
<Pp>"Stay out of this you chimpnut." He cocks his Xplodo Revolver and points it at the man's squarish head. "One step forward, I'm serious."</Pp>
<Pp>The pale man pries his jaws apart with his hands until his purple tongue flops out. It's like a slimy eel, swirling in wet circles. He points his finger down his undulating gullet. "That ish where you belong. Heh heh hehk."</Pp>
<Pp>"I <em>implore</em> you to get away from me." The handgun shakes in his fingers. "I will blast a hole through your skull. I'm not kidding around. I'd rather not have to scrub your brains off the goddam wall."</Pp>
<Pp>The pale man lunges forward. Chadmuth48 grips him by his clammy throat. The man hisses. Carves his overgrown nails deep into Chadmuth48's forehead skin. It rips like wax oozing bloodspurts and dribbles. Scrapes over and over again, deeper. The hand around the revolver loosens. Groans and grunts. The pale man is overpowering him. Chadmuth48 screams and starts blasting rounds out of his revolver. Which rupture against the tram's steel ceiling. Crushed into white hot flame. I shield my face with my arms. Shrapnel skids off every surface.</Pp>
<Pp>"Please enter or exit now."</Pp>
<Pp>Chadmuth48 jams the barrel of the gun between the man's dry purple lips. Then a splashy bang. Stringy hair on the back of his head disintegrates in a beam of fiery red water. I lock my eyes shut. Bolt towards the exit. Step off onto the platform. Doors close and roll away.</Pp>
<Pp>I'll have to walk very far. My clompy bootsteps echo down the long dark corridors. My eyes keep dripping and it's hard to breathe. Sometimes I swear the brown fungusy walls are squeezing in around me, like I'm walking through the stomach of an inwardly hairy urchin. I try my best to come up with some prayers, but none of them turn out good enough. Hope that soul finds peace.</Pp>
