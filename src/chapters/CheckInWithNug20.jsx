<p>The slides are especially slippery today. I plop out on the 3rd floor center hub and make my way to the east wing. I’m figuring I’ll check in with Nug20 first in case he has any important updates, then I’ll get some yummy nummies from the GrubZone, then I’ll head back up to the fifth floor so I can finally charge my celly and get to work. This area isn’t in its usual state of mania. It kind of seems like people are just chilling.</p>
<p>The door’s shut. I consider knocking, but I figure it’s probably fine to let myself in.</p>
<p>Purple gel is draining down a massive needle deep into Nug20’s belly. His face is squished into a rictus of pleasure.</p>
<p>“Oh my God. What are you doing?”</p>
<p>His eyelids slowly curl up. His speech is slurred. “I was enjoying my privacy. Before you invaded it.”</p>
<p>“It’s me. Jim29. You’re my supervisor, remember?”</p>
<p>“You’re actually Bunndy22 35Fludge. Because…see…I was Jim29’s supervisor, but he’s dead now.” He moans in pleasure, giggles.</p>
<p>“What are you injecting yourself with? Is that Sting??”</p>
<p>“So hwat?”</p>
<p>“Oh my God! That’s so bad for you. You can die from that.”</p>
<p>“Pot referring to the black kettle. You’re conshtantly self-medicating.”</p>
<p>“I don’t do scary stuff like this. This is creepy.”</p>
<p>“Ever tried it?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. And I never want to.”</p>
<p>He squeezes the bulb at the end of the needle, squirts the last couple drops into his tummy, and pulls it out tenderly. The hole in his skin is bubblingly violet. He patches it up with bandages that are the precise hue of his pale skin.</p>
<p>“I can’t descriibe the feeling. I suppose it feels like the taste of ripe cherries. I don’t mean Froot Cherri syrup. I guess you were born post-extinction. Buuut, the real flavor. Rich. Deep. Dark. That’s all my body tastes like. Hooo <em>wheee</em>.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>“Don’t gawk at me.”</p>
<p>“What? No way. I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>“This is the only way I can feel good anymore. Trust me. This world kills you from the inside.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m aware. I’m the one in this room who’s actually legally dead.”</p>
<p>“You really think my parents named me Nuggort20 43Dunc?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s clearly a machine-generated name. They resculpted my identity too.”</p>
<p>“Dam, really?? Why?”</p>
<p>“I worked on the Dimples ScanBuddy. My knot in the code defined a graphical interface for a program that patients could use to watch funny video clips on a screen inside the MRI machine for a small additional fee. Very simple clips. But humorous ones of course. Mostly celebrity blunders and animal mishaps. Anyway, the interface used too much memory. And if the ScanBuddy’s vents got blocked, the magnet would go haywire and grind people’s bodies into sausage.”</p>
<p>“Yuck. That’s awful.”</p>
<p>“And the consequences are real. My actions ended the lives of fifteen people. A couple kids even. I know how this feels for you. I’ve been in the exact same spot. Sure, life goes on. For a moment I even looked kinda sexy. But my brittle face bones deteriorated and my skin sagged. Now I have to get bi-weekly injections to prevent facial seepage. I’m alone and I look like a monster. I have nothing anymore.”</p>
<p>“Gosh. Well, at least you have your family.”</p>
<p>“They think I’m dead. All the headlines said I was wiping my butt too hard after a bowel movement, and the wiping friction was so much that I popped a buttcheek artery, and then I slipped on my own blood and urine and fell face first into the toilet, nearly flushing myself down, drowned.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear.”</p>
<p>“All I’m saying…is that it doesn’t get better. So you might as well feel like cherries.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Nothing to apologize for.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes I apologize just because I don’t know what else to say. I’m…going to go back to my pod.”</p>
<p>“Yes it got moved down to the fourth floor. You should have received a zoip about it.”</p>
<p>“Oh. OK. Good to know. See you later.”</p>
<p>“Nop. This is our last conversation. You’re gone, OK? We don’t know each other.”</p>
<p>“Hm. Goodbye.”</p>
<p>“Yop.”</p>
