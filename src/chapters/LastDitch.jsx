<Pp>I drag myself to the slide room. I hop in the slide that loops all the way up to the fifth floor. I don’t have time for describing.</Pp>
<Pp>I’m trying really hard to process things. I know God must’ve had a reason for this. He has so many awesome reasons for everything, but they’re just really weird reasons, and we’re never going to figure them out. He’s playing the long game…testing our faith…trying to trick us, in his own inscrutably benevolent way. I suspect he’s just that much of a mastermind.</Pp>
<Pp>He knew I was going to do everything I’ve ever done. I’d like to believe there’s some greater truth to be gleaned from analysis of any discrete occurrence, but I can’t discern any underlying moral. I don’t think I can make it make sense. I’d been rationalizing the two people who died on account of the big crash as victims of a greater system. Faceless casualties, I’d never have to meet them. I don’t remember their names. Their deaths weren’t even my fault anyway. But I killed this guy with my hands and now I’m wearing his clothes. The Bible definitely says you’re not allowed to do that. Even if it was self defense, I think I lose the benefit of the doubt the second time around. I’m starting to wonder whether I’m the problem.</Pp>
<Pp>I step out onto the fifth floor. According to the windows it’s dark red outside. I must’ve forgotten that it’s evening. It feels pretty weird to walk past my former workpod, since some other guy’s using it. He’s got his programming gloves on, UDP connected, totally in the mode. By the looks of it he seems like a nerd, no offense. Jumper56’s pod is just around the corner.</Pp>
<Pp>I knock on the door: “Hey.”</Pp>
<Pp>She jolts up in surprise.</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh! Ca-can I help you?”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s me. Jim29.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Really?” She squints her eyes. “God. Oh my GOD! You look so much worse every time.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I crashed my speedster. A lot of other bad things happened too. None of this is my fault. I don’t have any time for describing. Can you please drive me home?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Absolutely not.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Please!”</Pp>
<Pp>“You don’t sincerely believe in my humanity.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You don’t understand. They’re going to kill me. They’re going to feed me to a giant monster!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Are you having an episode or something? Have you been taking your daily suppies?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Stop it! I’m being serious!! And I guess technically I haven’t been taking my suppies.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Why haven’t you been taking them?”</Pp>
<Pp>“They trapped me. I had no access to them. Stop looking at me like that!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Can’t you get anyone else to drive you?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No one else. I’m begging you.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Wow. You really are such a remarkably wretched human being. You can’t think of a single person who would give you a ride home?”</Pp>
<Pp>“That’s not fair. I had a lot of friends at Knowledge Dome. They just moved away.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You mean they moved away, what, five <span class="t">*</span>years ago? And you haven’t made one single friend since?” Her eyes look very sharp. “Am I seriously your only friend?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Why are you being so hard on me?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Because you’re a bad person, Jim29! You’ve ended freaking lives! Why can’t you get that through your fnucking head?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I never caused that bug. I swear. I was framed.”</Pp>
<Pp>Jumper56 laughs with a volume that seems performative. “Why should I ever believe you? Also, why are you still trying to get me to drive you home? Why would I ever do that?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Alright fine. Here’s the deal. You can have all everything I own, all my gold. I know you’ll do something good with it. Just please make sure my birdies are OK.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m not sure I follow.”</Pp>
<Pp>“The passcode for my door is CompleteDaytime111. Can you write that down?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I need you to rewind a little. What’s going on?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m an agent of poison and waste, supporting the fulcrum of oppression. The soil would benefit from my absence. I’m going somewhere far away, where flowers grow.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Wait are you running away because I was mean to you?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m not a person. I’m a problem.”</Pp>
<Pp>“C’mon bud. You might’ve done some messed up stuff, but life keeps going. You’ll be fine.”</Pp>
<Pp>“The oceans haven’t melted yet. I’m going to go North, across the ice. I need to put myself somewhere else. I am blight.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Goodness! You are so annoying. Sounds like a really cool dramatic exit, yah, mhm! Literally no one cares about you. You just want to escape the need to try at anything, right? The need to do anything difficult? It’s a good plan. It’ll work out great.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Will you take care of my birdies? They’re helpless. You can have all of my gold. Every single speck of it.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Didn’t you put those cameras in their cages? So they could let themselves out? I remember you spent like fifteen <span class="t">*</span>minutes explaining me that.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah actually I did, you have a good memory. But they’d never pass the test. They have no sense of ego.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh of course. Sure.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you promise you’ll take care of em?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I guess if I have to. You’re sort of forcing it on me.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Goodbye, Jumper56.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Wait, are you like, going to kill yourself?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No. I’m going to walk to to the northern coast and try to cross the frozen ocean.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I wasn’t sure exactly how literal you were being.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You think there’s something on the other side?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Shouldn’t there be?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t know man. I don’t know about this. If I agree to take care of your birds, you’ll give me literally all your gold?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes. I promise.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I can give you a ride then. The north coast is pretty far away.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Really? Awesome. Tight.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Your whole scheme is bizarre and makes no sense, but I have no gold, so it’d be sorta stupid to turn you down. I can at least make sure you don’t get eaten alive along the way, lost in some Tier 4 golgotha.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Phew. I really do appreciate it. This has been the worst <span class="t">*</span>day of my life.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Mhm.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Wait, shoot, are you still struggling with that bug? Am I distracting you from that?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No I fixed it this morning. I didn’t need your help.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh OK. Very cool, nice.”</Pp>
