<p>“Dr. 85Grinski, I am in desperate need of today’s Happy Splash.”</p>
<p>He enters the splashing chamber from behind a velvet curtain. He’s wearing an earthtone man-gown and has his hair up in a vertical ponytail. Smiling, grinning, beaming.</p>
<p>“That is wonderful to hear, Jim29, because I would be more than happy too splash you.”</p>
<p>“Great. That sounds awesome. It’s like everything’s been shouting lately. I need a little peace and quiet.”</p>
<p>“I can dunk you extra if you’d like?”</p>
<p>“Really? I didn’t know that was an option.”</p>
<p>“Everything is always an option.”</p>
<p>“Dam. OK.”</p>
<p>I rest my neck on the lip of the basin. He grips my uncombed disc hair and shoves me face first into the pink splash. It stings in my eyes. I kick my legs and wriggle like a worm. I’ve lost count of the <span class="t">*</span>seconds. Can’t hear anything in the fluid besides bubblies. The chemicals are burning my receptors. I can’t breathe, but that’s just because I don’t have air. Which is starting to hurt. There’s nothing left. So lungs are shrinking. I’m swinging my fists back into my Happy Specialist’s belly but he keeps pushing me deeper. I’ve lost full sensation in my body. Then I’m yanked upward into the air, dripping.</p>
<p>My vision is blurry. He drops my limp body onto the sofa.</p>
<p>“I wish I could hold you under for longer, never pull you back up. Wouldn’t you like that you dumb sack of flesh? Huh?”</p>
<p>“I feel…good…”</p>
<p>“Yah. Of course you do, dumbass.”</p>
