      <p>Alone walking down the long hallway. Can’t find the door. Never remembered to get the directions. Stupid stupid stupid so stupid.</p>
      <p>Talking to myself on the celly. My nose sounds plugged up.</p>
      <p>Each flight of stairs I ascend places me lower. Each barred window overlooks a barren field. The air stinks of sweat. I’m walking out onto the basement balcony and looking out over the edge. My rosy cheeks sting from grinning.</p>
      <p>About to sled down the hill. I’m a child’s height. Scoping out my path.</p>
      <p>Finding a hole and crawling in. Lurching forward on my hands and knees for <span class="t">*</span>days, <span class="t">*</span>weeks, <span class="t">*</span>months, <span class="t">*</span>years.</p>
      <p>Is anyone there? Tell me you can hear me. Tell me what to know. Let me know that I’m alright.</p>
      <p>Mr. McBubble giving me a gigantic scrub. Suds cleansing my soul.</p>
      <p>Dr. Kindbrain tells me I’m a rotten fool.</p>
      <p>Dark except my monitor’s Ultradef glow. I hook my umbilical data plug into my tummy and type every key at once.</p>
      <Z d={30} spe={70} u="j56" ch={num} o={0} z={state} f l no> ONE</Z>
      <Z d={30} spe={70} u="q31" ch={num} o={1} z={state} f l no> WHERE</Z>
      <Z d={30} spe={70} u="n20" ch={num} o={2} z={state} f l no> THING</Z>
      <p>Data plug starting to hurt. Digging deep into my stomach. Can’t pull it out. Crawling down intestines, up throat. Scraping deeper as I gag coughing choking. I pull more and my body rips. Wheezing and retching. Cord squirms and squirts itself up deeper. Scraping up into my skull through the weak bone. Eyes slip out into my hands. Turn em around. Looking back up at my self bruised of oozing holes. Walls rumble as brain leaks through mouth’s ceiling. Swallowing myself.</p>
      <p>Everyone seems to think I’m rude?</p>
      <p>Being sucked upwards through a tube. Pressure makes my bones bend. Crushing confines.</p>
      <p>“Because you don’t exist.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t exist?”</p>
      <p>“You don’t exist. You don’t exist.”</p>
      <p>Driving Tulip around a racetrack. Not going super fast or anything.</p>
      <p>I’m on all fours crawling around on the grass in the garden atrium. I keep quietly asking myself “Whatsup?” in a certain way.</p>

//   <p>So I’m alone. Walking down the long hallway. Can’t find the door. Could be walking the wrong way. So impossible for me to tell. Never remembered to get the directions. Stupid stupid stupid so stupid.</p>
// <p>Each flight of stairs I ascend places me lower. Each barred window overlooks a barren field. The air stinks of sweat. It’s been a million <span class="t">*</span>years since I last saw the wonderful sky. I walk onto the basement balcony and look out over the edge. My rosy cheeks sting from grinning.</p>
// <p>The perfect door I find is a hole and I crawl in. I lurch forward on my hands and knees for <span class="t">*</span>days, weeks, <span class="t">*</span>months, <span class="t">*</span>years. My skin stretches thin and my bones hollow out. God dam it’s really taking a long time. Time swarms like flies when you’re having fun. Ain’t that what they always used to say? Is anyone there? Tell me you can hear me. Tell me what to know. Let me know that I’m alright. And I am here.</p>
// It’s dark except my monitor’s Ultradef glow. The keyboard feels rough neath my gnarled arthritic fingers. I hook my umbilical data plug into my tummy and type every key at once. GrubZone button tingles with incoming zoips.</p>
// <p>[[ TO DO: This text is gonna glow in wild colors, just iimaginee ]]</p>
// <p>NO ONE : NO WHERE NO ONE NO WHERE NO ONE NO WHERE</p>
// <p>NOT AT ALL : NOTHING NOT THING NOT AT ALL NOTHING NOT</p>
// <p>NO WHERE : NO ONE NO WHERE NO ONE NO WHERE NO ONE</p>
// <p>THING NOT AT : ALL NOTHING NOT THING NOT AT ALL/////////</p>
// <p>Data plug starts to hurt. Digging deep into my stomach. Can’t pull it out. It’s crawling down intestines, up the throat. Scraping deeper as I gag coughing choking. I pull more and my body rips. I am wheezing and retching. Cord squirms and sucks itself up deeper. Scraping up into my smooth skull through the weak wet bone. Eyes slip out into my hands. Turn em around. Looking back up at my self bruised of oozing holes. Walls rumble as brain leaks through mouth’s ceiling. Swallowing myself.</p>
// <p>I’m sucked upwards through a tube. Pressure makes my bones bend. Can’t move my arms within the crushing wetness. I start to scream while</p>
// <p>CAPILLARIES BURST, BONES SNAPPING, CRUNCHING, STABBING THE FLESH OF TISSUE, SKIN IS SHRED, BLOOD GUSHING, CARTILAGE TWISTING, BILE PUMPED THROUGH EVERY CHAMBER, BODY POPS LIKE A BALLOON, IT ALL BECOMES MUSH, WASTE, SCRAP, AND, AND</p>
// <p>I am in the tan room. Doby22 is smiling so wide his teeth wrap round his skull. He is positively grinning. He starts speaking politely. “Why don’t you care about me?”</p>
// <p>“Because you don’t exist.”</p>
// <p>“I don’t exist?”</p>
// <p>“You don’t exist. You don’t exist.”</p>
// <p>I trickle into the ground. My nutrients feed a flower to grow. It blooms and spits me out looking spiffy in my favorite outfit. I’m in the garden atrium, and I sit next to Jumper56 on the bench once more while stumbling through the tall grass yet again. I pull all my sets of lips apart so the teeth are clearly visible. “I’m glad I’ve gotten the chance to know you.”</p>
// <p>“It’s not going to get better for you y’know.”</p>
// <p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
// <p>“Imagine never to wake up, huh? Huh how about that?”</p>
// <p>“Am I asleep? Will I wake up?”</p>
// <p>“You aren’t awake.”</p>
// <p>“Can I go to sleep?”</p>
// <p>I crouch down in the tall grass. I yawn for the entirety of four hundred <span class="t">*</span>years. I cross my legs on the bench.</p>
// <p>“Am I done yet?”</p>
// <p>“Everyone else isn’t.”</p>
// <p>“Am I sweet yet?” I yank out my tongue and wipe it on my skin.</p>
// <p>“Don’t forget,” she yawns for just a <span class="t">*</span>second, “who, who you are.”</p>
// <p>Grandma looks back down at her crossword. “Nine letter word, down, last name of the best grandson.” She scribblies in the boxes. “0-3-G-O-L-D-M-A-N.”</p>
