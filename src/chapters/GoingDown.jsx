<Pp>“Can you hold the lantern for just one jiff?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Sure thing.”</Pp>
<Pp>“The screen isn’t reacting at all. I can’t type in my keycode.” The LED buttons are freezing cold and I give up. The gooey night continues to melt away, slowly revealing more of the choo choo station’s metaminimal architecture. None of the lights are lit. The air stinks of burning. The rails continue where the terrace ends, stretching over an impossible-to-see-across bottomless gorge open wide like a hungry gullet. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the power’s out. Can you pull up the nation map?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Ah doink, I’m reading Drip right now. Not good stuff. Magnitude six quake, about four thousand confirmed dead. Jesus.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Quit saying his name like that.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Whose name?” They look puzzled. “Wait you mean Jesus?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Whom else could I possibly be referring to?”</Pp>
<Pp>“That makes literally no sense. You <em>proclaim</em> his name in vain all the time.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Well, OK, maybe that’s true, but do you want there to be another earthquake?”</Pp>
<Pp>“What on earth do you mean? We’re right next to the Eternity Faultline. They’ve done so much drilling over there. You seriously think that was just God rustling the world around with his divine paws because he’s mad or something?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m superstitious, maybe. Suspicious. I don’t know.”</Pp>
<Pp>“That’s completely absurd. You’re doing yourself a disservice by believing things like that.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I respect you opinion.” I think I’m the one guilty of acting like a nut in this instance. “The entire choo choo system is shut down and I’m honestly freezing my butthole off already. Maybe I’m not thinking straight. Do you want to talk about something different?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Did you pull up Nation Map Extreme?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I told you to.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Why not just do it yourself?”</Pp>
<Pp>“My celly’s almost dead. 7% voltage.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Why didn’t you charge it like an adult?”</Pp>
<Pp>“You’re being mean as hell for no fricking reason.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Nation map says We’re on Tier 2, Terrace Star-Star-Octagon, surrounded on all sides by that Tier 3 gorge. Apparently the bed of the gorge two hundred feet down is Terrace Star-Circle-Octagon, Tier 3, people call it Stinky Town. My flat in Big Town is sixteen twentyleaps north. I don’t have a lot of unsponsored data left, so you better appreciate my generous sacrifice.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I do, I promise. But what you’re saying is there’s no other way back besides down? Not even a bridge or something?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yup. There’s a ladder a couple hundred leaps north.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Hooo-mama that sucks.”</Pp>
<Pp>We trudge northward. I am feeling highly ill at ease. “How long do you think until we get frostbite? Are we gonna freeze out here?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Look how fluffy you’re dressed! You’ll be fine.”</Pp>
<Pp>Tonight feels especially dark. Our lantern rocks back and forth like a pendulum along the arc of its handle, metallically whining.</Pp>
<Pp>Minutes pass and I keep talking a little more. “I’m sorry, I gotta stop acting like such a jerkoff freak. What’s wrong with me.” I convulse in full body shivers. “I shouldn’t have drank so much. I still feel so dizzy.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Me too.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m sorry for how unbearable I’ve been.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Don’t worry about it, you got smashed so much or whatever that you have Blooberry skin. You’re in pain. It’s OK.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Alright, cool.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Also it says that apparently this earthquake is named Travis.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Earthquake Travis huh? Kind of a nice name.”</Pp>
<Pp>We hold hands. I tell Quimby31 about how much I wanted to puke my guts out Thursday afternoon when I got the bug report. They nodded and I think they might’ve listened. Either way I did a pretty good job of telling the story.</Pp>
<Pp>The metal rungs of the Descent Station’s ladder descend out of a wide pipe reaching over the edge. There’s an elevator too, but of course it’s out of order. In times of emergency anyone can use an Ascent/Descent Station ladder for tier traversal, but it’s important to keep in mind that getting spotted on a tier above that which is designated by your social code is not only a huge faux pas, but the No More Upsters bill that passed last month made it a national offense punishable by incineration. I’m putting a lot of effort into making it seem like I’ve climbed down a ladder this tall before. I adopt a wide and confident stance along with super gentle, calm breathing. The wind roars and buffets my chest.</Pp>
<Pp>I ease my shaking feet down onto the second and third slippery rungs, which are formed out of an oddly thin and rough material not unlike that of a public bench. It’s a struggle to find the next foothold, but I refuse to look down into the sixty leap depths below me. I’m relying on my scrawny tired arms to keep me suspended as I picture my fingers unwrapping from the metal, the rush of air as my body yanks me heavily down, the collision with solid earth, the way my face crunches into my chest or my knees into my shoulders or my chin into my tush. My eyes point straight forward. The cliff face is rough sandstone and thick red ants scurry up and down its surface. As we climb I tell Quimby31 about the dreadful silence sitting on the bleachers mid-Morning Chat, about the cement slowness of my meeting with legal, about the very specific way my skin and bones felt crushed in the resculptor. It gets harder and harder to think of the details while hanging in the middle of my lantern-lit sphere of orange light, surrounded by an icy abyss, but I consider myself a pretty gifted storyteller.</Pp>
<Pp>“Hey Jim29.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I have to close my eyes. They’re getting rock hard.”</Pp>
<Pp>“OK. It is pretty effed up how cold it is. Are you enjoying my storytelling?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I can’t feel my legs.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah you’re right. The cold is sucking the spirit out of my bones.”</Pp>
<Pp>“It hurts so much. It’s so cold that it flips into being warm, kind of.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah, absolutely. I’m slightly scalding.”</Pp>
<Pp>Clunk, clunk, clunk. Hands and feet against metal.</Pp>
<Pp>I raise my heavy brows. “It’s not really that bad actually, once you get used to it.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah, I guess. It’s not terrible.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’d like it if it were warmer, but this isn’t the end of the world.”</Pp>
<Pp>“By the way Jim29, I can’t see anything. My eyes are totally shut. If I slip and fall, I’ll probably knock you down too.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Nuthin I can really do about that, I don’t think.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah, I’m just saying.”  I can hear their hoarse breathing and shivering teeth. “Good to keep in mind.”</Pp>
