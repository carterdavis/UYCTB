<Pp>We take the stairs two at a time. Their hand is warm and soft. The steps are deep and not quite wide enough. I can feel those dizzy spins. I'm having trouble thinking of what exactly to say, but I'm enjoying trying to figure it out in my head. Flight after flight of stairs.</Pp>
<Pp>We're going west, which means we need to ride the red rail, Cabooster. I'm hoping my Cabooster profile has some netgold left. I scan my face and order us two choo choo tickets. The system assigns us fourth class seats after calculating my <span class="t">*</span>yearly income and cheerfully greets "Good evening, Bunndy22 35Fludge." The cabin is clean and comfortable. Could be worse.</Pp>
<Pp>"When I commuted to Knowledge Dome I always had to ride eighth class," I say.</Pp>
<Pp>"Huh. How was that experience?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It always smelled like sweat and recent puke." The coal roars and the train starts rolling. "They'd always search our bags. I think they were looking for drugs. Sometimes they'd slam us against the wall and choke our necks."</Pp>
<Pp>"I can only imagine." They run their fingers through their hair. "Have I ever told you about the time I got sick?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>We get up from our seats and transfer to line 4.</Pp>
<Pp>"Remember way back, before the first Great Freeze, when there were still mosquitoes?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
<Pp>"So I'm ten <span class="t">*</span>years old riding a ferris wheel, and a horse mosquito the size of my fist lands on my shoulder. Sucks up a cup or two of my blood before I can even notice. I don't think much of it. Next Thursday I ride an ambulance from the Knowledge Dome to the hospital. I'm sweating, I have the chills, I can't stop throwing up all over. The hospital is dusty, rundown, and the only one in the region with any open space. Doctor takes some cultures and diagnoses me with double malaria. That was that kind that was super resistant to antibiotics, you know? Sure enough, my organs start failing."</Pp>
<Pp>We get up from our seats and transfer to line B.</Pp>
<Pp>"Man, you never told me about that. How do they treat that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Within a few <span class="t">*</span>days I end up on life support. Can't hear anything over the whirr of machinery. Big fat tubes pump air into my lungs and blood through my veins. Most of my muscles aren't responding. The best I can do is open my eyes every now and then, enough to look around the empty room I'm in. I get pretty used to the idea that either my life would end or wouldn't get much better. One or the other.</Pp>
<Pp>"A scene's seared in my memory where I can see my parents, eyes gushing, talking with the doctor. My mom turns, says I love you, but I can't hear it. They leave, and the doctor leaves. It's just me and the dust they kicked up. It has that look in the mid-afternoon sun where each dusty little particle lights up and sparkles. I try to follow one with my eyes and see where it ends up. They swirl and collide like they're dancing. I decide that I don't want to stop seeing things, and I shut my eyes closed."</Pp>
<Pp>We get up from our seats and transfer to the salmon line.</Pp>
<Pp>They look nervous all of a sudden. "Is this an engaging story?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, why?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You just haven't said anything."</Pp>
<Pp>"Only cuz I'm listening."</Pp>
<Pp>"As luck would have it, a couple <span class="t">*</span>weeks pass and there's a speedster crash. Two people're carted into the ICU completely ripped open, but their organs are in good shape. The surgeons slice a long slit through my abdomen and rip out my belly, kidneys, heart, and 'testines, all chalky and yellow and spurting fluid onto their scrubs. They swap in a new set they yanked out of the crash victims and staple it all into place. They even leave me with an extra heart. That's why my chest thumps twice as much. Just a few <span class="t">*</span>weeks pass and I'm able to breathe and run and laugh again."</Pp>
<Pp>"That's nuts." I think about my breathing again and feel the slow rising of my chest.</Pp>
<Pp>"But do you get what I mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh I thought you were just telling a story."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, I probably should have been a little more obvious. What I guess I was trying to say was that those machines were all that was keeping me alive. All my parts were busted! And you work on those kinds of machines every <span class="t">*</span>day, making them better. Y'know? People really need people like you, is what I mean. Because you're smart and you care."</Pp>
<Pp>The train rolls to a stop. I put my arm around their shoulder. We walk beneath the cloudy night sky. The rocky path is littered with broken canisters, plastic bags, and stamped on printed out online scoops. The frozen black ice of the ocean looks like an endless chasm stretching out to the horizon, marking the edge of everything. We sit down. They place the lantern gently in front of us. The gooey darkness continues to recede.</Pp>
<Pp>I ask politely, "Can I tell you something?"</Pp>
<Pp>"For sure. Spill it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nah, I shouldn't say it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Come on you dweeb!!"</Pp>
<Pp>My cheeks are warm. "No, I really shouldn't."</Pp>
<Pp>"Please tell me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"OK, fine." I look them right in the green eyes. "I love you."</Pp>
<Pp>They go quiet and rigid. "I wouldn't say that I love you back."</Pp>
<Pp>The wind howls. They're looking anywhere else. We shiver in the cold.</Pp>
<Pp>"Why not?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"
"Why don't you love me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What kind of question is that?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't know!"</Pp>
<Pp>"You want me to tell you?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes."</Pp>
<Pp>"OK. Hmm. Well, you're so self-centered."</Pp>
<Pp>"You think so?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah. And you're so eager to please. But I think that's just because deep down you're afraid of being abandoned. You want people to depend on you. At the same time, you feel so much contempt for people you've never met. You get so angry when people aren't cynical in the precise way that you are. Your morals are so confusing. So often you're just actually unkind. And when someone points out that you're being unkind, you're always surprised like oh, this is so completely new to me. Your whole belief system hinges on you being the most virtuous person, the most authentic person, the sweetest person. I don't really even get what you want out of this world. You never really try at anything and you hold yourself in such high esteem. Like, everything about you is so suffocating to be around sometimes. Makes me want to throw up."</Pp>
<Pp>I scratch my frozen eyebrows. "Is there anything you love about me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Sure, of course."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you tell me what those are?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I love your smile. You have a really nice laugh too. You're a really great listener, and you're there for people when they need you. You desperately want to be a good person. You know exactly what you think about everything and you know exactly why."</Pp>
<Pp>"...Is that it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, why?"</Pp>
<Pp>"That list is a lot shorter."</Pp>
<Pp>"Quality versus quantity."</Pp>
<Pp>"I have a much longer version of that list for you."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher99 cinches their hood tightly around their face. "I don't want to hear it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"You know what my favorite bible verse is?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think so."</Pp>
<Pp>"Genesis 2:19. 'So out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.'"</Pp>
<Pp>"My name is Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think we'll go to hell when we die. Or heaven. I think we'll just start to float forever."</Pp>
<Pp>"That just sounds like heaven, muchacho. Except in heaven you get wings."</Pp>
<Pp>The ground trembles. It throbs and roars enormously beneath us. They grab hold of my midsection. The sound is a deafening growl, it makes my ears sting. It's a sound that can devour the sky. I bend over and cover my neck. The soil shudders, metal screams as it bends. They're squeezing tightly. I forget to breathe.</Pp>
