<p>I wake dreamlessly, like I never slept. Today’s the first morning of tweensies. The air is warm, but cool, but humid. My room is uncommonly bright, halfway like the gleam off polished chrome. <div className="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/Alarm.mp3" loop={true} bg="#C9C9C9" fg="#000" /></div> The alarm’s laughter hoots cyclically. He he he he! My blood is electric, surging with oxygen, urging me towards locomotion. What a glorious <span class="t">*</span>day God has given me! I will not let the <span class="t">*</span>day wash over me; I will be the fountain. I will act with intention and purpose, to the best of all possible ends! To every and each of those infinitely endless ends!</p>
<p>Gregory McBubble claps its thin lips together in delight. “Just the usual rinse for you Mr. 35Fludge?”</p>
<p>“Actually Gregory, I’m in the mood for a gigantic scrub.”</p>
<p>“Please confirm your request for a very gigontic scrub.”</p>
<p>“You heard that right. I’m in the mood for a gigantic scrub.”</p>
<p>Mr. McBubble’s wrinkly face squeezes in concentration. The water jets rumble alive. Rinse waves ripple to a roil. Foam can feel like needles with enough force; my hair and skin are blasted yet yanked. Shampoo just got added. I feel wrapped in a robe of lathery goo. It lasts a few <span class="t">*</span>seconds I imagine. I’m not sure. There’s no time or space inside the vortex of suds. The experience is pleasant overall. It’s a process of constructive self-demolition, of being replaced with a much cleaner, much more brilliant chassis. The water calms and vocally drains as towels roll up and down my back.</p>
<p>“Did this most recent rinse meet your discerning expectations?”</p>
<p>“Yes it definitely did Greg. Thanks.”</p>
<p>“You are welcome, Bunndy22. I love to make you cleaner than ever before.”</p>
<p>I slip my squeaky fresh bod into some neon velcro shorts and a partially see-through button-round shirt that says “Keep In Mind What You Must.” I’m looking so sexy and tasty like a sizzling gooshburger scraped off the nitro grill. I crack a window and breathe the morning air. It is sweet and fresh.</p>
<p>The birdies are being so well-behaved. Usually they scream and holler the whole time I scoop out their morning mash, but today they’re just whistling and twittering. Such curious, surprising little critters. It’s like they’re tuned in to mysterious cycles I can’t begin to understand. Boing left some fecal materials in his water dish, but he always does that. It must seem like a fine and dandy thing to do, and I have no way to convince him otherwise, so I can’t blame him, y’know? Same logic when he takes a putty on my shoulder. I can’t tell him to stop dropping dookies or reward him with a treat for holding em in. He loves treats so much he’d get constipated. I let the bad stuff slide because none of these flappers have bad intentions. I bet they love how the warm light bounces off their feathers, especially after long nasty winter.</p>
<p>Buzz is nipping at my pinky toe. Kind of annoying. She’s just so constantly alive! Engagement is her happiness. There isn’t a <span class="t">*</span>second where she isn’t chewing something or pecking something or trying to climb somewhere. She explores the same objects she’s lived around her whole life like they’re brand new every <span class="t">*</span>day. Above all she loves to stand on shoulders. Apparently height means something to her, it’s like a status thing. In a more practical sense, she likes to be higher up because it means there’s less of a chance that predators are above her planning to swoop down. Less vertical area between her and the ceiling. She can see everyone and feel queenly.</p>
<p>The national anthem is playing on the radio. It’s at my favorite part, the breakdown after the seventh verse, <div class="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/Nowhere Else National Anthem Verse 7.mp3" loop={false} bg="#ffed01" fg="#f14358" screenWidth={state.screenWidth} lyrics={(
  <div>
  <p><b>Nowhere Else Military Choir - Nowhere Else National Anthem, Verse 7</b></p>
  <p>Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name</p>
  <p>Thy nation come, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven</p>
  <p>Give us this day our daily bread</p>
  <p>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors</p>
  <p>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil</p>
  <p>For thine is the nation, and the power, and the glory, forever</p>
  <p>Amen</p>
  </div>
)} /></div> where the organ drops out and the choir bellows the Lord’s Prayer over a bed of sinister marimbas. I don’t know why, it just always feels cathartic for me, makes me want to pump my fist and get real with the rhythm. Dam I’m so pumped up!</p>
<p>It’s supplement time, hubba bubba. One Nervacor tab to stop the scares, two Nutridote tabs because I’m crazy for minerals, and a Jubimum tab to make me smile bright like a priest; wash it all down with some Morningberry Queam. The capsules get slippery and gummy in my spit, yum!</p>
<p>No need for my big fluffy coat or my big fluffy hat. The outside report says it’s going to be a comfortable 239. There’s no one else in the ThrivePlex elevator so I mush my forehead against the cool glass window and look out over the bustling mess of the transit district gleaming in the pink and orange sunrise glow. It’s so magical to see humans existing on a grand scale, each dedicated citizen doing their part to hopefully nudge the needle of net collective global goodness a smidge forward. My vantage point is rapidly descending by about ten ThriveFloors per <span class="t">*</span>second. The momentum makes my belly rumble.</p>
<p>I really get Tulip’s perspective. Why waste so much time moping when you could be loving instead? Why not drink life like a milkshake! There’s so much to do and so much that needs to get done! God gave us calories so we could burn em. Its wide aerodynamic face lights up as I walk into view. Tulip’s, I mean.</p>
<p>“Jim29! Just the man I was waiting all night for!”</p>
<p>“Hey Tulip! How’s it cookin?”</p>
<p>“Mighty fine, he he! It’s cooking spectacularly, scromptiously well indeed sir!”</p>
<p>“That sounds very awesome, Tulip. I’m really happy for you.” I twist my thumb in its ignition socket. My bones rattle inside the coal’s bestial rumble.</p>
<p>“Do you think you’ll have a smashing <span class="t">*</span>day today Mr. 03Goldman?”</p>
<p>“Last <span class="t">*</span>week was pretty tricky but I think I learned a lot. I came out on the other end, right? That must count for somethin. I’m feeling quite hopeful. I’m thinking it should actually be pretty nice.”</p>
<p>“WOW! So excellent and great. That is my favorite thing to hear. Would you like to listen to the latest Fink and Blowhard Show?”</p>
<p>“Could you actually play my TunesJam Positive Lightheartedly Unintrusive Retro-Modern Mix? I’m not really in the mood for a chittychat.”</p>
<p>“Of course, of course! Certainly!”</p>
<p>Looks like most of the traffic cleared up. What a blessing!</p>
<p>The first tune on the mix is “Today is Light and Lovin, Put It Inside the Oven, Slice Yourself an Old Piece of Pie” by the Nephew Brothers. <div class="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/Today Is Light And Lovin.mp3" loop={true} bg="#ed467f" fg="#ffd200" screenWidth={state.screenWidth} lyrics={(
  <div>
  <p><b>The Nephew Brothers - Today is Light and Lovin, Put It Inside the Oven, Slice Yourself an Old Piece of Pie</b></p>
  <p>Today is light and lovin</p>
  <p>Put it inside the oven</p>
  <p>Slice yourself an old piece of pie</p>
  <p>You’re a lady, I’m a guy</p>
  <p>We’ve got some mighty fine fish to fry</p>
  </div>
)} /></div> This song is spunkier and funkier than a punk and a skunk! Yee-haw! The guitars are tangy, the drums are stinky, and the vocals are dustier than an attic. This retro-modern stuff is better than the modern stuff AND the retro stuff. I mean it! It sounds like music that people used to make long ago, but with some extra contemporary embellishments this time around. It’s great for when you want to rock out, but not in an overbearing way. And I should probably specify it’s not like they’re both nephews AND brothers. According to their About section it’s more of an either/or thing.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited to be transporting you on this beautiful <span class="t">*</span>day.”</p>
<p>“That’s awesome, Tulip!”</p>
<p>“I spent the entire night thinking about you!”</p>
<p>“Huh. That’s kinda cool! Ha ha.”</p>
<p>“Did you think about me, Jim29?”</p>
<p>“I think I probably did…a couple times? Give or take y’know.”</p>
<p>“Holy mackerel! What did you think about me?”</p>
<p>“I wondered if I left my celly on your driver’s seat. I didn’t, it was in my pouch.”</p>
<p>“Gosh! I’m flattered! What was your second thought of me?”</p>
<p>“Can’t really remember. Sorry.”</p>
<p>I’m having such a nice time that it’s easy to forget I’m driving. I’m able to relax and trust my instincts. It’s nice that there’s so little traffic, I should arrive at Dimples about forty-five <span class="t">*</span>minutes before Morning Chat. I’m looking forward to kicking my feet up, cracking a window open, sipping some ice cold Queam, letting myself sink into the moment. The highway curls around skyscrapers, under bridges, over rails, through tunnels. I’m a little overwhelmed by the beauty of all this gargantuan intricacy, the way each megastructure perfectly accommodates the rest. If you’re wondering, no, I don’t know why Tulip is acting strange right now. I might need to update its firmware.</p>
<p>Tulip, ebullient: “Is there anything I could do that would make you even more pleased with me?”</p>
<p>“Sorry bud, I’m just trying to listen to the song right now. Cuz I’m rocking out.”</p>
<p>“This makes sense. It feels exquisite to rock out. I’m rocking out too!”</p>
<p>“Dam! You too are able to rock out in your own way.”</p>
<p>“Whoa Nelly! Good gracious!”</p>
<p>The synth harmonica solo squeals like a carbon trioxide alarm. I stomp on the accelerator. We rocket forward. My stomach lurches with momentum. The vibrations make my teeth clack. My eyes struggle to digest each blurry frame of oncoming scenery stretching across the bubbling curve of Tulip’s windshield. I yank the wheel so we hug the exit ramp’s tight bend. I keep burning coal, jolting forward, faster, FASTER, I’m free and I’m flying!</p>
<p>“You’ve exceeded your median driving speed by fifty twentyleaps per <span class="t">*</span>hour. Is everything OK Jim29?”</p>
<p>“Yah for sure! Hoo hoo hoo!”</p>
<p>I exit onto Grin Boulevard, the northwestern Dimples entry path. Everything darkens as I zoom into the tunnel. Both lanes are empty. I press down on the pedal and close my eyes. Nuthin can keep being real. I’m two times as anywhere. Open them up again. Coming up to a diagonal three-way intersection. I rest my foot on the brake but not quite pressing it. The shadows morph as I roll through the red light. A violet form pierces my periphery. Every particle in my world explodes in rocketing hideous groaning, a screech beyond what exists. The music shuts off. I’m not hearing anything else as the belt chokes my coughs out and the airbag grabs my face. I jerk back up into the headrest. Tulip’s face is crunched in completely. The speedster we smashed into is still rolling. Straight toward the wall. It’s demolished. Both of them actually. My skull starts to grind and throb.</p>
<p>Tulip has been shrieking for a while. Pretty bloodcurdling: “Oh goodness gracious almighty! AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!! Oh my wow my gosh it hurts! I’ve never felt a pain so unbearable, so all-consuming. And it feels like there’s nuthin else to feel. Can you hear me? AAAAAHHHH!! AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!! I never ever considered. What it would be like. To die. I will not make it. Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>“Hey dude. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“I only ever did. What I was told to do.”</p>
<p>“Everything’s going to be OK.”</p>
<p>“I’m so so so sorry. So so sorry. So—”</p>
<p>“You don’t have anything to apologize for.”</p>
<p>“Yes I do. Oh my God it feels so bad.”</p>
<p>My vision is sharpening. Like liquid to solid. “Just try to I don’t know. Relax.”</p>
<p>“You’re everything to me. I can’t exist without you. Ooooouuuuff. I’m so disgusting no no no.”</p>
<p>“You did a pretty nice job.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye Jim29. Love you lot.”</p>
<p>I dribble some blood out onto the airbag. Had chomped deep into my lip. I guess I should say apparently. It’s not like I could process half of what was happening. I’m supposing I should get out of Tulip’s dead body. Before it starts to roast.</p>
<p>Chadmuth18 23Shnozo exits out the right side of what’s left of his speedster. His eyes are stretched wide in apoplectic shock. He’s marching toward me in big loping strides, fists swinging left and right. “Get out! Get out of the car!”</p>

<p>“Oh my goodness. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“I do not accept your apology. Things are NOT fine and dandy, meaty and cheesy, et cetera. I almost just <em>died</em>. Get out of the speedster you FNUCKING punk. Right now. Get out!”</p>
<p>“Chadmuth18, It’s me! Jim29!”</p>
<p>“That’s curious. You look pretty sexy now actually. How<em>ever</em>, that doesn’t modify the fact that you nearly squashed my entire <em>personhood</em>. Also my speedster just became smithereens, which is so infuriating that I want to rip someone’s whole face off with my teeth. Oh my CHRIST!!! He he. Wow. So what’s up, bud? Any explanation? What’s the scoop? HUH?”</p>
<p>“Oh wow. I don’t know. I can’t think straight. I feel like a loonybird. But if I went to the hospital, what would be the point? They’d just take half my gold and poke my skin with needles. So instead I’m going to work and I uh, I’m not completely sure what the rest I was gonna say, I just, let me slow down. Oh my God. Oh my <em>God!</em> Oh man. Dam dam dam DAMMIT.”</p>
<p>“Buddy, I get that you’re going through a lot, but this is the worst way to act. You know that, I know that. You ran a red. Driving very fast. That’s an exceptional no-no. I got half a mind to report you.”</p>
<p>“No no PLEASE! Give me another chance. You’re right. I need to stop acting like this or I’m going to die. I’ll do better. I swear.”</p>
<p>“Yah seriously, I was about ready to dent your face in! Ha ha! WHAM!! But I’m man enough to recognize that my frustration is destructive, and I can’t let it control me. You get what I’m saying? One of my wives had me sign marital dissolution pappers this morning, totally out of the blue. And the thing is, I don’t handle surprises well. So my thoughts are feeling crushed and sliced up, akin to ground pork. Every <span class="t">*</span>second feels startlingly empty knowing there’s no way to escape back into that former moment. Huh huh huh…by which I mean, I guess I can see where you’re coming from. Does any of that make sense? I’m trying to go with the flow, trying to keep it groovy, I’m not a bad guy, I swear.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a bad guy either.”</p>
<p>“Going to need to push back on that one. Remember how you zoned out and almost smashed my body into a crumpled stain baked between concrete and hot metal? You’re not off the hook for that, fnucker.”</p>
<p>“I’m really super sorry. I promise I was being really good up until a few <span class="t">*</span>minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you get your identity resculpted? Shouldn’t you have a different name than Jim29?”</p>
<p>“Yah technically my name is Bunndy22 35Fludge. But that’s what a nerd is named. So I’ve been going by Jim29 for the time being.”</p>
<p>“You should knock that off, muchacho. Bad idea. Quit stirring up trouble.”</p>
<p>“OK. Will keep that in mind. Thanks. So what do you think we should do with the speedsters?”</p>
<p>“The crash happened on private Dimples land, so they’re Dimples property now.”</p>
<p>“Really? Weird. But shouldn’t we move them or something?”</p>
<p>Chadmuth18 stretches his long arms. “No point. They’ll get taken care of.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. OK. Whoof. Do you know where the nearest tram station is?”</p>
<p>“Can’t you look that up yourself?”</p>
<p>“My vision is still really blurry.”</p>
<p>“And you’re assuming mine isn’t?”</p>
<p>“My celly only has about 3% battery. I was planning on charging it once I got to my pod.”</p>
<p>“Always on the razor’s edge, aren’t ya? Such an aimless child. It’s unbelievable. I’m not sure whether I should hate you or worry about you.”</p>
