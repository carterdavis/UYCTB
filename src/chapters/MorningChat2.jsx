<Pp>I’m three <span class="t">*</span>minutes late for Morning Chat. Augustinius00 01Stone is center stage, arms akimbo, deep into the Morning Stretch. His hologram face is calmly smiling, eyes closed. I find a seat way up in the 70th west row. My legs feel like jelly. I’ve been trying to scrape some coagulated bloodsquirt (from when the guy’s head blew up) off the sleeve of my button round using my sharp fingernails. I’m giggling to myself a little bit, can’t help it. Feeling Happy. The CEO of the company I work for addresses the crowd.</Pp>
<Pp>“Good morning, Dimplers! Can I get a Modestday Boo-yah?”</Pp>
<Pp>The bleachers roar. “BOO-YAH!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Goodness unto the LORD! You guys are the best. This company is just sensational. This place is like Genius City. Here, let me roll up my sleeves.”</Pp>
<Pp>His hologram demonstrates the unusually bumpy texture of his arm skin.</Pp>
<Pp>“You see that? You guys give me goosebumps!”</Pp>
<Pp>Much applause. The hologram smiles so big and wide. There’s a really positive vibe in here. I’m actually having a good time.</Pp>
<Pp>“So many people are counting on us to survive. More often than not, their fate ends up in our hands. No big deal. We're so talented and powerful! We're like legendary immortals such as those found in the tales of old. Can I get an indeed?”</Pp>
<Pp>All in unison: “INDEED!”</Pp>
<Pp>“My goodness. OK. Where do I begin? Well...Uh, there’s actually one scoop I need to address before we get into the real meat of today’s chat. Our colleague Jim29 03Goldman was found unresponsive in his bathroom last night. Forensic analysis indicates that he used a bloody knife, found near his body, to saw his own head off. His head fell into the toilet, and the authorities suspect that during his final <span class="t">*</span>seconds he was—and now mind you this is just a rumor, take this with a grain of salt—but apparently, the authorities suspect he was trying to flush it.”</Pp>
<Pp>There is a hushed silence. A couple gasps.</Pp>
<Pp>“So utterly tragic. What a shame. The suffering in this world. I tell ya. What I would give to wish it all away.</Pp>
<Pp>“I hope you don’t think I sound like a wimp or a nerd for getting all wah-wah, crybaby, life is so hard; cuz nop, not here, your chief executive officer is NOT going soft on ya. The fact of the matter is, he was a deadbeat rotten murderer. And it’s not like any of us knew him or liked him. But it’s only ever sad to see an innovator lose his wings.”</Pp>
<Pp>My vision is hazy, I can’t blink it away. This room is so echoey. I’m just trying not to drool.</Pp>
<Pp>“Anyway, enough about that. There’s a lot hap happity happenin today. We're launching a mandatory patch for the Autoflosser 7VX to fix the 'gum-grind' bug. And if I recall correctly we received numerous reports that the beta SuppyTime Purchasing Appliance isn’t processing orders quickly enough. In a couple cases, front door tablet deliveries were an entire four <span class="t">*</span>minutes late. We can do better than that, right? Sure we can. Everything is amazing. You do realize that, don’t you?!”</Pp>
<Pp>A great deal of applause for that rhetorical Q.</Pp>
<Pp>“They say blessed are those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death. Which is to say, all I ask is that you take chances, make mistakes. That’s how you grow, my dear friends. Neither a wise man nor a brave man lies down on the tracks of history to wait for the choo choo of the future to run him over. Pain will nourish your courage.”</Pp>
<Pp>His hologram’s eyes turn into huge cartoon hearts.</Pp>
<Pp>“I love you all. So, so much. God put us here together for a very good reason. We're the lead architects of soon-to-be history. Are ye not mighty? HA HA! Let’s make names for ourselves. Let’s be the finest, think the loudest, and fill every corner with our supernatural grace. Amen, amen, amen.”</Pp>
