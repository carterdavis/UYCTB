<Pp>I awake in the fetal position with a mouth full of salty ocean water. The rays of dawn are brilliant and pink in the perfectly clear sky. My body feels horrendous. My head is pumping with pressure and my stomach is full of spikes. I’m feeling the withdrawal symptoms for Nervacor, Dexagent, Nutridote, and Jubimum simultaneously. I’m completely soaked. The ice floe is bobbing up and down. My guts feel like they’re imploding. In the warm sun I am terrified and weak. I’m glad my mindchip still has battery. It feels good to know I can at least get this story down and tell it in my inimitable style.</Pp>
<Pp>I must’ve been trapped in the Soaking Pit for longer than I was aware. Otherwise I don’t get why everything melted so fast. I sit up on my rear and attempt to orient myself. I’m sitting on a substantially large, gradually rotating slab of ice. How can I know which way is north? I feel nothing but panic and dread.</Pp>
<Pp>I try to stand up but it is so fricking slippery. What the hell, oh my, uh, alright, let me get my balance here. OK. I think the worst idea in this moment would be to stay right where I am. In this place my death is guaranteed. But if I go somewhere different I might be able to prolong my misfortune. I think very hard. Once I’m done thinking I choose a direction that is about 174 degrees to my left. I step forth with confidence and bravery in my heart. That’s the key to walking when it’s slippery. I step forward once, twice, 5 times, pure confidence, 13 times, I hop onto another ice floe, 22 times, 35 times, nothing but bravery, 48 times, I kick my feet to hop onto another ice floe but my dominant foot slips out from beneath me. I flop onto the ice and the whole slab jerks downward. I slip into water. Warmth’s replaced by pain. Heavy and frigid. I thrash my appendages. Cannot generate upward lift. Have air but not much. I zip off my heavy boots, kick downward, keep doing it. I crane my neck up and I can barely breathe. The solid ice keeps drifting farther away. I have no hope of reaching it. I push down with all available force and lift my voice to shriek “SAVE ME GOD! NO!!!! HELP!! OHMYGOD!! JESUS!! JEEESUS!!! SAVE ME! I'M DROWNING!! I CAN'T SWIM!! GOD IN HEAVEN! CHRIST!! GOD!!! FNUCK!! OH NO!! GOD! WHAT HAVE I DONE?? WHAT DID I DO, GOD!! I NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM DON’T LET ME—<em>gurgling</em>—AAAAAHHHH!!!!! JESUS FNUCKING CHRIST—<em>gargling</em>—AAAAAIIIEEEEEE!!! NO NO NO NO NO PLEASE OHMYGOD NO DON’T DO THIS TO ME DON’T!!!” My voice is sore, I start coughing up water, my limbs are completely numb, I can’t think of anything, pale dot in the pink sky, keep kicking, crane neck up again, bigger pale dot from on high, can’t kick anymore, sinking, pale hand in my eye, sinking beneath, closed shut, one gulp of air then back to falling. Until I am grasped entirely and yanked upward by the enormous limb of a transparent being.</Pp>

<Pp>Its hand forms a complete seal around me. I’m accelerating upwards into the sky. The fingers are solid like glass but with candy-colored tongues of lightning zapping around inside. Behind them I can see the ocean, the black clouds of Nowhere Else, even landforms I never knew, dropping out of sight. The planet reveals its roundness. My encasement rockets upwards. I don’t know where I’m going. Everything else descends out of view. The sky turns into black. We zip by the enormous rocky moon. I’m so damp. I’m getting pruney. There’s some water splashing around in here too. I think we just shot past Neptune, or maybe that was a different blue planet. Stomach lurches and feel like I’m about to barf. The motion hurts my eyes. I don’t think we’re in the solar system anymore. I fall over onto my stomach. Eyes point downward.  I spot the receding spiralling stars of a galaxy, glimmering dust of a nebula, mostly rocks. Light makes my eyes sting. I desperately bang my fists against the limits of my enclosure. I shout “BACK! TAKE ME BACK!! NO! BACK!! BACK!!!” And then I think I’m &nbsp;&nbsp; yanked&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; up&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; out&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; And,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; can&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; see&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; MANY&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; new&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; colors,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; only&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; could&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; show&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; you&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; hand&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; opens&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; up&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; can&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; see&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; out&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; over&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ultra&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; colored&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; biting&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; smiles&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; unfurling&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; flowering&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; spectral&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; shimmering&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; mirror&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; teeth&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; slavering&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; curling&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; into&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; wild&nbsp;&nbsp; coils&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; like&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; mathematic.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Ten&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; thousand&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; faces&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; triple&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; the&nbsp; mouths&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; noses&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; grin&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; until&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; they&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; morph&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; dissolve.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; am&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; pulled&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; closer.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; am&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; stared&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; right&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; into&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; gnashing&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; tissue.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; try&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; speak&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; but&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; there’s&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; left&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; my&nbsp; lungs,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; sound&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; either&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; so&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; yes&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; gaggg&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; wheeeze&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; wave&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; attention&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; bathe&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; shine&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; its&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; infinite&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; everpresence&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; its&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; proud&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; voice&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; obliterates&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; my&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; hearing&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; mind:</Pp>
