<Pp>I'm sitting in a chair at their dining room table. Neher31 is seated across from me.</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you feeling OK?"</Pp>
<Pp>Me? "Not really."</Pp>
<Pp>"You kept throwing up over and over."</Pp>
<Pp>"I need to go to sleep. So so tired."</Pp>
<Pp>"We did walk a really long way."</Pp>
<Pp>I make my face pouty. "Can I sleep on your triangular sofa?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No. I'm sorry Jim29, but I'm kicking you out. I don't want you to barf on my items."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm so flipping scared."</Pp>
<Pp>"You told me that like twenty times on the walk back. You're scared, I get it."</Pp>
<Pp>"Aren't you scared?"</Pp>
<Pp>They pour themselves a piping hot ramekin of sticky water. "That's just how the law works. It needs to be enforced. Enforcement is inherently scary."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can I tell you something?"</Pp>
<Pp>They shrug. "Might as well."</Pp>
<Pp>"I still haven't fixed that bug. The one that got on the news."</Pp>
<Pp>"Fairly believable."</Pp>
<Pp>"You think that's who I am?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You have some serious problems."</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm trying really hard, I promise."</Pp>
<Pp>They are quiet for a <span class="t">*</span>minute, seeming on the cusp of speaking. I'm getting used to the way my face feels in my hands.</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you sure you didn't send me that note on Fog?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What? Yes, I mean I didn't, I totally swear. Why would you ask me again?"</Pp>
<Pp>A slug drops from the ceiling and splats onto the table. They crinkle their eyes under their fists.</Pp>
<Pp>"Will you just leave? I wanted to be alone tonight. This was such a waste."</Pp>
