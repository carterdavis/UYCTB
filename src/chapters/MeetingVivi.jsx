<p>The ladder is jammed stuck at the bottom against a clumpy brown mound swarming with more thick ants. I lower my shaky foot onto its frozen surface. The lantern illuminates a well-stomped trail down the mound’s slope into the bed of the gorge. My muscles ache with wiggly tiredness. There’s not even a breeze. Yellowing bones from unknown bodies jut out of the terrain. Some are spiky, some are round.</p>
<p>Quimby31 drops down. “So this is terrace Star-Circle-Octagon.” They blow warm air on their raw hands. “There should be an Ascent Station about a couple twentyleaps north from here.”</p>
<p>“Shh. Listen to that.”</p>
<p>“Listen to what?”</p>
<p>“Nuthin at all, I mean. It’s so quiet down here. Isn’t it amazing?”</p>
<p>“I have tinnitus. The ringing just sounds especially loud.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that. Is it genetic? Or from exposure?”</p>
<p>“Congenital, passed down from my dad. Kind of a generational thing. Can we start walking again? I really want to be home.”</p>
<p>“Yah no, that definitely makes sense, absolutely.”</p>
<p>A twentyleap isn’t that far, and a couple is literally only a bit farther. My thoughts sound quiet like a church. The mound is icy-slick as it slopes downward. I slip once and nearly plop on my bottom. Quimby31 leans forward like they’re there to catch me but not enough that they’d be able to break my fall; it’s more of a symbolic gesture.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#dfd2a0, #e73b8e">
<p>I can barely make out a small girl sitting among a pile of grey rocks in the distance. She’s sitting criss crossed, lit by a coal lantern burning to her left. As we walk closer, she appears to be wearing four or five layers of faded sweatshirts and a metallic helmet that looks at least one size too big. She is humming a song from an advertisement to herself. I can’t fully remember the product it was an advertisement for, but the melody activates a decrepit region of my biomemory reserved solely for old teevee commercial songs. The thick overlapped sweatshirt sleeves make her arms look very wide and stumpy. Her dark hair is twisty tied into symmetrical horizontal pigtails. She’s clutching a bulbous purple plush creature that appears to have been heavily appreciated over the <span class="t">*</span>years.</p>
<p>Her face lights up and she starts waving her arms all around. “Hi! Hello! Hoo hoo! Hi!!”</p>
<p>I wave and say “Hello!” We keep walking and shivering down the path.</p>
<p>“Are you from up above?” Her vowels squeak a little bit.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#e73b8e, #efa173, #2f2f2f">
<p>I do a smile. “Yah!”</p>
<p>“Can you help my grandpoppa? He’s very sick. His machine is from up above. It doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>I stop and turn. “What kind of machine is it?”</p>
<p>Quimby31 pulls my arm forward. “C’mon, we really gotta keep movin.”</p>
<p>“My name is Vivi__ __Grimple! Or you can call me Viv__. I like both! What happened to your face?”</p>
<p>Her lack of numbers indicates that she’s unregistered. That probably means her family couldn’t afford the registration cost. The price of names keeps going up. A few big corps bought up most of the names, <Snip screenWidth={state.screenWidth} bg='#575382'>The three name resale giants are Titularity, Appellatio, and Namerr.</Snip> so normal names are pricey. People in her situation aren’t an anomaly; they just can’t afford it anymore. It’s only a big deal if you get caught. Must be a discomforting precarity.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Jim29. This is Quimby31. I hurt my face in an accident.”</p>
<p>Most medical devices run Dimples zoftware. We’ve basically cornered the market. What if her grandpoppa’s machine is malfunctioning because of the error I caused? I feel compelled to try and help.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#2f2f2f, #bf7690, #efa173">
<p>Vivi__ lifts her stuffie into the air by its haunches. It’s three-legged, rotund, and seems to be missing an eye. “This is Broophy!!” She wiggles its limbs around in the air. </p>
<p>Quimby31 crosses their arms close to their person. “Why are you outside right now? It’s so cold.”</p>
<p>“I’m playing Cold-Hot-Cold. Do you know how to play that game? I came up with it. It’s where you sit outside and you get cold until you get OH SO COLD. Then you go inside and get hot again! Then you go back outside again. Wanna try?”</p>
<p>It’s hard for me to fully process what she’s saying cuz my mind is off wondering how I’d debug a Dimples machine without my computerior. I wouldn’t want to wipe its saved state. It must have some kinda way to log in. “We’re pretty cold already. I think I might actually maybe be able to help your grandpoppa.”</p>
<p>“Wowo! Stupendous.”</p>
<p>“Where is he?”</p>
<p>“Inside. But I’m not cold yet.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Gotcha.”</p>
<p>Quite a few <span class="t">*</span>seconds pass. The expression on her face is serene.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#efa173, #af499b, #dfd2a0, #efa173">
<p>“When do you think you’ll get cold?”</p>
<p>Quimby31, whispering in my ear: <em>“Uh, so, what are we doing…?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m being nice.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s like 12:30! I’m tired! I want to go home.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You were just telling me how important the work I do is! I want to try and help these people.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Look, I get that, it’s just—”</em></p>
<p>“OK I’m cold now.” She picks up her lantern. “Let’s go inside.” She starts walking into the darkness.</p>
<p>I do an “ah shoot, what the heck” kind of shrug. Quimby31 seems annoyed but resigned.</p>
<p>Vivi__’s stride is loping and fairly brisk. She guides us over jagged outcroppings only half visible in the murk. The ground is menacing, littered with assorted things such as ants, supplement bottles, busted gizmos, fool’s gold, soiled bandages, and sharp half-eaten canisters of frosty golden creamed kernels. I really have to watch my step.</p>
<p>Quimby31 is still shivering quite a lot. I’m a little nervous about their comfort. “What do you like to do for fun, Vivi__?”</p>
<p>“Well mostly I like to sing, talk to Broophy, and play Cold-Hot-Cold. I help all <span class="t">*</span>day, and I only get to play at night.”</p>
<p>“How responsible of you. What do you do to help?”</p>
<p>Her home enters the lantern glow. It’s a modest residence, probably contains two or three rooms max. The concrete and metal is painted pink and orange. A garland of papper flowers festoons the roof’s edge. There’s a seesaw off to the right, and a small shed to the left. Smoke billows out of the chimney.</p>

<p>“I play on the seesaw.”</p>
<p>“That’s fun!”</p>
<p>“The seesaw SUCKS!! UGGH…no one will seesaw with me, not even Broophy. But it’s a water pump seesaw. Playworks gave it to us. <Snip screenWidth={state.screenWidth} bg='#bf7690'>Playworks is a charity founded by Spcl. Duke Edward00 00Normus with a stated purpose of “pragmatically harnessing the joyful productivity of our nation’s youngest workers.”</Snip> If I don’t seesaw we don’t drink water. Momma is too busy to do it. Seesawing means my legs are so strong and fast now! Look, I’m running! Wheee!”</p>
<p>Vivi__ runs an oval path around us. She sure is speedy.</p>
</Pp>
<Z d={20} spe={68} u="j56" ch={num} seq="b" o={0} z={state} f> i’m sorry. i wasn’t being very empathetic</Z>

<Pp bg="#2f2f2f, #e73b8e, #dfd2a0, #bf7690">
<p>The welcome mat looks fairly flattened. The wiring around the door buzzer is exposed. It sparks when Vivi__ gives it a buzz. We wait half a <span class="t">*</span>minute for her mother to answer the door. She’s slouched over and massaging the back of her neck. The rims of her eyes are red.</p>
<p>“Vivian__, who are these people?”</p>
<p>“He’ll help grandpoppa!” She points at me. “He said—”</p>
<p>“No, sorry, but no. I’m sorry sir. Have a good night.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? I think I can fix it.”</p>
<p>Vivi__ scampers into the hot interior. Mrs. __Grimple rubs her temples. Her face betrays some mild agony.</p>
<p>“We just, we don’t have much gold. You can’t take what we have left.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’d do it for free!”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yop.”</p>
<p>“You promise? No hidden fees?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Definitely.”</p>
<p>She closes her eyes and massages her brow. “OK, that’s very sweet of you. Come inside. Would you like any sticky water? I have some on the burner.”</p>
<p>“That’d be great, thanks.”</p>
<p>The __Grimple residence is about as charmingly cluttered as my cubby. We take off our boots and leave them by the door. The interior is lit by yellow LEDs screwed into the walls. It smells like some kind of broth. Coal is roasting in the fireplace. Feels nice to warm up and defrost. Dirty dishes are piling up in the sink. The shelves are tightly packed with baskets of dehydrated corn, books, knick knacks, coupons, cleaning supplies, sweaters, etc. Vivi__ is standing over a little end table carving shapes out of magazine pages with a miniature blade.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#bf7690, #575382, #af499b, #efa173">
<p>Mrs. __Grimple fills two canisters to the brim with the steamy, jiggly water. She carefully hands em to us. Her computerior is open at the end of the countertop, logged into some kind of facial descriptor program. <Snip screenWidth={state.screenWidth} bg='#efa173'>Facial description workers get paid hourly to categorize harvested human face data according to its emotional characteristics. It seems like she’s just categorizing between “Happy” or “Sad,” but the options can get much more complicated. Algorithms trained on the categorized data can determine human feelings via physical expressions. Technology like this enables Tulip to know when I’m feeling upset.</Snip> “So what company do you work for?”</p>
<p>“Dimples, actually. Is it a Dimples machine?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That was our only option.”</p>
<p>“OK, cool! I can try and figure it out then. What kind of illness does he have?”</p>
<p>“One night he stepped on an ant nest. Came home with about 200 bites. The venom still hasn’t left his system and, well, he’s old, so…”</p>
<p>“Where is he?”</p>
<p>She points across the room. “Door on the left.” She proceeds to hurriedly scrub a saucepan.</p>
<p>I make an effort to step around Vivi__’s various papper art projects. She’s watching a cracked plasmoid teevee. Must be old as dirt. There’s a bright yellow 3D monkey on screen. It’s head is rolling around on the ground with no apparent destination. Neon colors are strobing. <div class="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/Teevee Music.mp3" loop={true} bg="#e73b8e" fg="#dfd2a0" /></div> Some kind of noodle monster just walked into the frame. Why does the camera keep zooming in and out? The music is all squiggly and rubbery. Doesn’t sound quite like anything that would be listened to. Maybe this is what kids like now? I don’t know. It’s not for me.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#efa173, #e73b8e, #bf7690, #dfd2a0">
<p>The door creaks resonantly and the room behind it is filled with the dim, blue and pink glow of lifesaving technology. Quimby31 followed me in but she seems pretty engrossed in her celly. I guess Vivi__ followed us in too. Her grandfather is floating in a plexi-glass chamber full of foggy liquid, which is attached to his Dimples All-In-One Life Sustainment System Z20 Extreme. I started work at Dimples around the time we were shipping out the Z23 Extreme, but this model is still a few <span class="t">*</span>months away from total obsolescence.</p>
<p>“Do you have the login token for this machine?”</p>
<p>She blinks at me. “What’s a login token?”</p>
<p>“It should have been on the box. I need it to log in. Do you have the box?”</p>
<p>“Momma says we don’t have room for boxes.”</p>
<p>I walk back out into the main room. “Excuse me ma’am, do you happen to have the login token for the Dimples machine? I think it was on the box it came in.”</p>
<p>Mrs. __Grimple looks up from her computerior. “What?”</p>
<p>“I need the login token for the Z20 Extreme. I don’t know what password the service technician used. The login token would enable me log into the machine without its password. Or do you have the password?”</p>
<p>She rests her chin on her hand. “I wasn’t around when they set it up, and they didn’t leave the box.”</p>
<p>“Alright, gotcha. Hmm…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Her eyes are searching. “I was taking Vivi__ to Knowledge Dome and running errands at the time. I…don’t know.”</p>
<p>“OK, it’s fine, no worries.”</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#dfd2a0, #af499b, #575382, #efa173, #e73b8e">
<p>Passwords for Dimples machines are allowed to be a maximum length of 32 case-insensitive alphanumeric characters, excluding any special symbols. I’ll have to do some guesswork. I type in all my default password ideas with the Z20 keyboard: “1234”, “123456789”, “abc123”, “dimples”, “123dimples”… Each incorrect guess is met with a startling “DOINK!” noise from the system’s speakers. I keep typing and pressing return.</p>
<p>“DOINK! DOINK! DOINK!”</p>
<p>Quimby31 puts their arm on my shoulder. “It’s OK if you can’t fix it.”</p>
<p>“DOINK! DOINK! DOINK! DOINK DOINK!”</p>
<p>“I’m sure I can fix it. I just need to get access.”</p>
<p>“DOINK!”</p>
<p>“Can you get access without making that hellacious racket?”</p>
<p>“DOINK! DOINK!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any other way. It’s a system noise, so I can’t turn the volume down. I’m sure the engineers had a reason for making it so loud.”</p>
<p>I take more time to think between my guesses. Still:</p>
<p>“DOINK!…DOINK!…DOINK!…”</p>
<p>I forget to even type anything in before hitting return. It makes a beautiful boingy boing noise and a loading screen pops up, informing me that it is Scavenging For System Dump, Please Sit Still A Few <span class="t">*</span>Seconds. The account’s password must’ve just been blank. I didn’t even know blank passwords were allowed. The loading animation depicts a very small man pushing an even smaller rock up a little pipsqueak hill. He just can’t quite seem to push it all the way to the top without losing his grip. The stone rolls very quickly all the way back down over and over and over in fluid vector animation. I wish it would just show a percentage instead. <span class="t">*</span>Minutes pass.</p>
<p>Vivi__ is walking around in a circle, stepping one foot in front of the other, arms outstretched for balance. She must have placed her torch in a wall mounted sconce. Quimby31 is on her celly and scrolling, eyes darting up, down, zigzagging around.</p>
<p>The loading man finally rolls the stone all the way up to the hill’s apex. He looks triumphant before instantly fading into the black void of the command line.</p>

<p>It’s pretty hard to concentrate with Vivi__ vocalizing another advertisement anthem, <div class="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/Splishtime.mp3" loop={true} bg="rgb(186, 255, 236)" fg="#000" screenWidth={state.screenWidth} lyrics={(

Vivi__ is doodling a lovely 3D-printed plexiglass cottage tucked between the cement supports of a blocked-off expressway ramp, tracing her unsteady lines with a black surgical marker on the back of a red-lettered medical debt bill.</p>
<p>Quimby31 taps the upper-left corner of their screen, then the bottom-right, then the upper-left again. Their celly is a sleek, stylish model, wide and long enough to really get lost in. “…and that’s not even counting any children. Heavens, can you even imagine?…”</p>

<p>“Alright Vivi__, I think this machine will work better now. It got turned off because of some kind of error. I’m pretty sure the error is fixed now. He’ll be getting more medicine.”</p>
<p>She stands up from her doodling. “So he’ll be OK now?”</p>
<p>“I hope so. That’s the thing about medicine, about health and life in general, y’know? You just have to hope. I work on machines like this, though, and I’m going to work hard to make sure that they run better for people like your grandpop.”</p>
<p>She slowly nods.</p>
<p>“Did you hear that more than hundred thousand are confirmed dead because of that quake?” Quimby31 is hugging their celly against their chest. “That’s unbelievable.”</p>
<p>I do a variation on the typical kind of shrug. “Yah, I guess.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I guess I just think it does sound fairly believable.”</p>
<p>Vivi__ exits the room and I follow.</p>
<p>“Maybe this is a dumb time to be cynical?”</p>
<p>“Yah you’re right.”</p>
<p>Vivi__’s in the kitchen, speaking quietly to her mother. They hug.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your help,” says Mrs. __Grimple. “We really appreciate it.”</p>
<p>My hands aren’t occupied so I do a thumbs up. “No problem. Could you by chance help us find the northern Ascent Station? We’re lost and trying to get home.”</p>

<p>Quimby31 and Vivi__ are done getting dressed. They step out into the frigid night. I’m still tying my boots. My fingers aren’t very nimble.</p>
<p>“The bill for the Dimples machine. We can’t afford it. What happens if we miss a payment?”</p>
<p>“Um, I’m not sure. I think the software probably stops running.”</p>
<p>“We’ve maxed out three credit accounts trying to keep him alive. We’re drowning.” Her eyes well up. She seems to be holding back sobs. I don’t know what to do in this kind of situation.</p>
<p>“Oh. Man. I’m so sorry. I don’t know if I can do anything to help, I’m just a developer. Hm. Have you called 24/7 customer support?”</p>
<p>She wipes her eyes with a folded-up gelpad. “Yes. They just left me on hold. I didn’t have enough TeleMinutes left on my celly.”</p>

// <Pp>This might look like just a bunch of hogwash to you, and it’s OK if it does. The command line (or the console, or the shell) is like a conversation portal ON the computering device WITH the device, spoken in its special computational tongue. You can tell it to do things and ask it questions. It is good at talking so long as you know just what to say. Anything can be done through the console, which is a thrilling idea to ponder. But however, if you don’t know the language, it might as well be a big old pile of baloney!</Pp>
// <Pp>At the beginning of our exchange, the shell delivers its ritualistic greeting. One very interesting factoid is that the text of that greeting was generated by our data steward using a proprietary Dimples module called Ear2Ear. System engineers designed the module to help Deward translate condensed logical network data into Central Standard-encoded human language. On occasion it’ll glitch out and get totally messed up, but it works most of the time and the console supports a lot of handy commands. I don’t think Deward likes me, and that’s fine, because I detest Deward. It tries to personally tailor its text to suit how it thinks I think, but, well-intentioned as it may be, it has this strange abrasive personality, and it speaks in halting unpleasant phrases, and I still have no clue why it colors certain words the way it does. Most of all I hate it when Deward tries to bust out some slang.</Pp>
// <Pp>On the first line with the arrows (>> means the spot where I can start typing) we ask what files are in the current directory. Some stock commands require certain “courtesy keywords" — these were introduced by Dimples as a way to try to reduce hardware abuse rates at the company. Apparently over the <span class="t">*</span>years it grew common for some of the stronger, taller employees to respond to a failing test or confusing error by crushing their computeriors’ screens between their biceps or furiously body-slamming them into the floor. <span class="t">*</span>Years have passed and hardware abuse rates haven’t dipped at all, not even slightly, but now if we were to remove the keywords it’d break a million or so different scripts we have running in the server barn, so, here I am, still having to tell Deward PLEASE and THANKS. There are a handful of folders in this directory and a couple files. Dimples installations always get dumped into the “default" folder, I guess because no one ever bothered to rename it.</Pp>
// <Pp>That wasn’t very nice of me to say. That’s not the kind of thing I think very often. On line 2 we CLIMB INTO the /default folder. I like to imagine the computering device hoists itself up into the folder with a rope and a snug harness. Note my courteous tone, THANKS.

// <Pp>On the following line, we ask the computering device again, PLEASE, what files are in this folder. Is this making sense? Am I moving too fast? You can be honest. I just think maybe this is important, and I wouldn’t want things to get confusing. I hope I’m not being rude. Let me know if you have any questions, OK. I just get worried sometimes.</Pp>
// <Pp>Lastly, ultimately, we EXAMINE state.dump. This is where Dimples Z20 plops all of the incoming data from the equality network. This data composes an incomplete, temporary snapshot of the application’s present status. All that junk gets formatted in DynoBracket, and if you’re not already accustomed to such an old, crusty encoding it can be pretty challenging to visually parse. My advice is to just look at it like descending levels of containers, sort of like how we use parentheticals. It’s a structure with depth, describing tiers delimited by ugly brackets. It’s interesting that the filters didn’t let any of Mjmubhe__’s grandpa’s name through, but I guess that’s just kind of how it goes sometimes. It doesn’t look like the system considers that an error, only a nuisance to keep in mind. The real issue is down lower, with the variable CURVE_QUOTIENT. The bad news is that this is certainly an instance of my bug, and I really don’t want to think about the full extent of what that means. The good news is that I found the problem, and grandpa floating in the tank will be able to live a bit longer. If this were any normal variable, I could access its data in the command line with the reference STATE.PHARMA.CURVE_QUOTIENT, but this variable contains what are commonly called “impossible digits.”</Pp>
// <Pp>For the sake of full disclosure, I don’t have a sub-surface understanding of what impossible digits are. Their existence is a bit of a mystery, and I’m only even aware of them because I read so many good scoops. As far as I know, some scientists blame their proliferation on the collision of higher-dimensional hyperstatic cuboids, whereas others argue that they’re just a curious side-effect of thermomagnetic bloating. I don’t know what I believe, and I don’t want to mislead you, OK? Maybe you’ve heard how they’re formed, and you can tell me if you want. The point is, CURVE_QUOTIENT contains impossible digits, so its current value is inaccessible. Introducing those kinds of digits into the datascape could lead to hardware malfunction, so the system returns a nasty error instead. I’m not sure where that crud data is being generated, but if you recall line 495 in intensity-and-dosage.tangle:</Pp>
// <Pp>UNFRACTIONATE(0 ≥ STATE[PHARMA[CURVE_QUOTIENT]] ≤ 1);</Pp>
// <Pp>that indicates that CURVE_QUOTIENT’s value is expected to be a rational number equal to 0, 1, or somewhere in between em both. The tricky part is, the data currently ascribed to CURVE_QUOTIENT both exists and doesn’t exist, stuck in an unique halfway realm of impossibility. The only way to interact with it is to overwrite it.</Pp>
