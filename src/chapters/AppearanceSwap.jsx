<Pp>I’ve been thinking about my expression: where my eyes are placed, where my mouth is placed, what my eyes look like. Soft and rubbery, soggy and blank. That’s who I am to every other person. I walk for a while, take a slide, do some more walking.</Pp>
<Pp>Glem22 21Ninkus swings the door open as soon as my knuckles make contact. His head is completely obscured, densely wrapped in black cords roughly a quarter inch thick like a rubber band ball. They shift and wriggle as he moves through space. “Bunndy22! Do I have that right?”</Pp>
<Pp>I elect not to respond.</Pp>
<Pp>“Glem22, nice to meet ya.” His voice is gruff. We scan each other’s fingerprints. His hand is soft and warm, his grip gentle but firm. “You’re the one in need of some resculpting?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I guess.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You can take a seat. I’m just getting my equipment set up.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do I have to do this? From a legal standpoint?” The chair is wooden and rigid. My body feels foreign, like I’m actually located two inches below where I’m sitting.</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes sir!” He wheels out a large amorphous white machine with a hefty touchscreen on its side. “This is just normal corporate procedure. You’ll be back to living like normal in no time.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What are you going to do to me?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m just going to use this Dimples FaceFriend to get some measurements. We’ll factor them into generating your outfit.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Interesting. How does the algorithm generate outfits? Like, what sorts of data does the FaceFriend collect?”</Pp>
<Pp>A human face-shaped indentation sinks into the side of the machine. Glem22 beckons with his fingers. “Would you mind squeezing your head on in there?”</Pp>
<Pp>I get up out of my chair. “No problem.”</Pp>
<Pp>The white indentation is cold, soft, and wet, like strange foam. I ease my face into it, feeling it grip my features. It gets tougher and tougher to push forward. My head’s in past the ears. The foam jiggles and pulls my skin in different spots. I can hear the machine’s whirring in my head. It feels like my whole skull is getting kissed.</Pp>
<Pp>The texture of the foam turns hard like concrete. It pushes in from all angles, slowly at first. It squeezes my features and bends my bones. The pressure is excruciating. I shove my hands against the side of the machine but my head’s totally stuck. It pushes in heavier and heavier, crushing my muscles and breaking my bones. My legs spasm and kick the floor. I squeal and shriek but it comes out gurgling. It pushes my eyes closer together. It pushes my mouth farther down. It pushes my cheekbones up. I hear crunching and snapping. I can’t say anything to describe the pain. At a certain point I don’t feel any.</Pp>
<Pp>After a <span class="t">*</span>minute of crushing the machine lets go of my head. I droop down to the floor limp and whimpering, tasting and smelling blood leaking out my mouth and nose.</Pp>
<Pp>He gestures to the machine. “This baby’s actually running on Dimples Z21. Kind of cool to think that some of your code probably helps it kick into gear.”</Pp>
<Pp>My temples throb combustibly. Vision is fog.</Pp>
<Pp>“I tell people we’re just going to take measurements because it’s always easier if they don’t know what’s in store. I hope you can forgive me, sport.”</Pp>
<Pp>I feel my face in my hands. It’s covered in a smooth, soft synthetic material. I can open my mouth and breath through my nose. The contours are someone else’s.</Pp>
<Pp>“We start you off with one of those plasticky things to make sure your face doesn’t reject its new shape. Think of it like a cast for your whole face.”</Pp>
<Pp>I lie face down on the floor. My skin is void of sensation.</Pp>
<Pp>Glem22 makes an effort to be cheerful. “I have your brand new outfit picked out for you! I think it’ll look really special.”</Pp>
<Pp>…</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s a blue unisuit with a pink shirt. And a bowler hat, to boot.”</Pp>
<Pp>…</Pp>
<Pp>“I understand if you’re not much of a hat fella. I just thought it was a little snazzy.”</Pp>
<Pp>…</Pp>
<Pp>“You sure you don’t want to try it on?”</Pp>
<Pp>…</Pp>
<Pp>“I’ll leave it hanging on the hook here. Does that sound OK with you?”</Pp>
<Pp>…</Pp>
<Pp>“You’re going to have to get up at some point. Act like an adult.”</Pp>
<Pp>…</Pp>
