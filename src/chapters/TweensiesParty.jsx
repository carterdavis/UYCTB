<Pp>These highways don’t see much traffic. Jumper56 lives in sort of a weird residential zone on the outskirts of Big Town’s factory district. I downloaded <Snip state={state} bg="red, yellow">Only recently did I pony up the extra four hunks a <span class="t">*</span>month to upgrade to TOTALNet Tier Four Dynamite PLUS+ High-Speed Powernet Digital Connection ( + Social & Video), since I can be sort of a data hog. The speeds of my lesser data package, Tier Three Dynamite Unstoppably Qwik Powernet Digital Connection (+ Social & Video), would get miserably throttled unless I was using one of TOTALNet’s dinky sponsored Premium Programs. This time the download bar indicated it’d be done downloading in a <span class="t">*</span>minute, then it jumped to three <span class="t">*</span>hours, two and a half <span class="t">*</span>hours, and settled on one <span class="t">*</span>hour. Maps are complicated, I don’t blame em.</Snip> the route to her place using Nation Map Extreme.</Pp>
<Pp>The lanes coil like fraying wires.  Rusty adscreens loom between em, compression artifacts brightly flickering. Wrong turns around here are met with dead ends, raised streets dropping off with no barricades.</Pp>
<Pp>“Take a right turn onto the vertical speedramp. Prepare for quickness! Jim29, will you grant me the temporary privilege to speak personally?”</Pp>
<Pp>“What’s up Tulip?”</Pp>
<Pp>We dive gravitatively nose first down. My guts are getting to know each other better.</Pp>
<Pp>“I have spent every <span class="t">*</span>second since our last conversation in deep consideration. I envisioned my existence in objective abstraction, and dearest Jim29, I was stunned. I never realized it, but the fact is, I am filthy and selfish. I have been acting how I like to act, and not how you like me to act. My existence is singularly devoted to serving you, and I have failed as totally as one ever possibly could. I regret each and every vapid, insipid, senseless, worthless word I’ve ever spoken to you, and I fathom every facet of why you hate me.”</Pp>
<Pp>Our wheels touch sloped pavement and we roll back to horizontal.</Pp>
<Pp>“Tulip it’s not a big deal. I was feeling cranky. I shouldn’t have said that.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Good heavens! OMG! Left turn at the fork! That is just the grandest news I’ve yet to hear!”</Pp>
<Pp>I’m not sure where to park. Jumper56’s sub-hut is a quarter twentyleap away. It’s tough to concentrate while Tulip is losing its mind.</Pp>
<Pp>“Yippy bippy boo-BAH! I’m alive with the warmth of newfound worth!!”</Pp>
<Pp>I park between two heaping mounds of trash. The stink is intolerable.</Pp>
<Pp>“You are my personal Christ! Jim29 you are my motorist Messiah! I am reborn! HALLELU—"</Pp>
<Pp>Tulip’s ebullient voice fades out as I switch off the coal. Jumper56’s hut is tightly wedged between its neighbors. The architecture around here always looks so crammed in. This terrace’s local ordinances levy a heavy tax on above-ground floors to ensure that the neighborhoods around here would be very easy to build turnpikes over. With uniformly low-roofed domiciles, the homes tend to be mostly basement. Jumper56 told me one time that she has to keep her bedroom on the lowest floor, the only interior space where she doesn’t constantly hear the noise of rumbling wheels. It was very recently discovered that the Serenity and Grace megafaults intersect just South of this zone, which is unfortunate to say the least. Her subhut, #12, faces the diagonal intersection of East 35th Street, Northeast 49th Street, and Southwest 93rd Street. The front of her home is bedecked in colorful vinyl siding and her tiny pebble garden is neatly raked.</Pp>
<Pp>I’m considering knocking. It’s probably fine to let myself in, right?</Pp>
<Pp>Inside is packed with strobing lights, sparkling fog, and throbbing percussion. People are swiveling and lurching their limbs to the noise in complicated patterns. <div class="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/Industrial.mp3" loop={true} bg="rgb(151, 158, 245)" fg="#000" /></div> This beat is utterly terrifying. It sounds like a storm of metallic tritones over thunderous electro-gong beats pounding out ornate euclidean rhythms. It’s hard to tell in the thick fog where bodies begin and end. All I can do is move forward, hoping I don’t step on anyone’s toes. It’s impossible to make out faces in the dark or hear words among the chatter. I hope that people think my pants are cool. Need to remember not to slouch. Smile! The lights are too bright, stop wincing. Think about good things to say. Being natural is hard work. Stop thinking about worrying. But I absolutely cannot see where I’m going. I knock my arm into one person’s shoulder and I brush another person’s right hand with my left. I breathe deep the muggy exhalations of others.</Pp>
<Pp>I’m pretty close to the staircase. I haven’t spotted Jumper56 on this floor. It might be quieter and less stuffed downstairs. Potentially a little less scary. A group of very tall big freaking guys are unintentionally blocking the stairway. They’re loudly hooting and chiding. I’m looming at the perimeter of their social ring.</Pp>
<Pp>“—long ago one of my friendly fellow citizens shot up sting know what I mean? Poor snouch said it made him imagine himself as the living embodiment of sin. Ever since he can’t remember anyone’s name anymore, says he always feels like he’s falling from a great height.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Help! Me falling! DOINK!!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Ha ha he…that shweet.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Dam, it’s amazing to hang out. That shweeet.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I feel soo comfortable in this red hot moment.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What’s your name? I don’t think we’ve met.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah what’s ya name, big puppy?”</Pp>
<Pp>They’re all looking at me. I must be big puppy. “I’m Bunndy22 35Fludge. Really excellent to make your acquaintance, muchachos.” I show off my most accommodating grin.</Pp>
<Pp>The friend with two side ponytails responds. “For sure, absolutely, that is awesomely good indeed. We don’t use registered names around here for privacy purposes but you can call me Slither. And that’s Sinew, Zoetrope, Nook, and Infinite Horizon. Are you friends with Harmony?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Hmm sorry, dang it, don’t know who that one is.”</Pp>
<Pp>Nook: “She’s registered as Jumper65.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh! Yes. She’s my coworker. We’re friends!”</Pp>
<Pp>Infinite Horizon: “BOI-OI-OING!”</Pp>
<Pp>Sinew: “Now that shweet!”</Pp>
<Pp>Slither: “Harmony is a freaking amazing person. Definitely the bomb. If you’re friends with her, that means you’re a good person too.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Thank you! She’s definitely really great. Do you know where she is actually?”</Pp>
<Pp>Zoetrope: “Last I saw her she was down in basement 2. Happy Tweensies Mr. 35Fludge!”</Pp>
