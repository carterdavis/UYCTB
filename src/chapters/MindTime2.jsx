<p>If you’re being honest with yourself, Jim29, all of your injuries are self-inflicted. No one is excluded from their complete and entire blame, and that means you!! Every single choice you have ever made is in gluttonous worship of your own personhood. You go to bed early, you wake up late, you never take anything seriously, you never listen to anyone else, you consume, you waste. Famine, drought, flooding, and earthquakes are manufactured by your pollutive mess lifestyle, by the votes you cast, by the funds you waste. The poor are poorer and the sick are sicker and you sit in your comfy chair gulping Queam and skimming your online news. You deserve the deepest punishment. People are dead because of you.</p>
<p>You could order some pre-processed kernels from TOTAL Distribution tonight. They’d slide down the U-Mail-It chute round the start of Business Time. You could hop in Tulip and leave Big Town, drive up north, finally find that perfect latitudinal slice where the air isn’t frigid or scalding; I’m sure if you did some searching online you could find a place that isn’t also being bombed by the government. If you plant those kernels and water them regularly, I bet you they’d probably grow into food. You could possibly even erect a yurt near the coast of a lagoon. By that point you’d be a fully natural man, like those of ancient myth. Imagine waking up in that yurt bright and early, tending to your fields of corn, feeling the soil beneath your fingers, gazing into the crystal blue waters of your personal lagoon. I suppose you’d also need to order a full-spectrum lantern to feed your crops since the sun’s light gets eaten up by the big black clouds. Plug the lantern into a generator, bring a few barrels of coal to keep the generator running. Also I guess it would be really hard to manage without your everyday suppies. Two <span class="t">*</span>days without your suppies and you start thrashing like a chimp.</p>
<p>No, you don’t have a life here, and you’d have even less of a life anywhere else. You’re only alive because you aren’t dead yet. You’re a cyst growing deep within God’s dermis, begging to be carved free.</p>
