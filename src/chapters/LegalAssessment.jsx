<Pp>I sign into the computering device at the legal desk. The chairs for visitors are really modern and pretty hard on my back. I can hear the sound of shouting through the walls. My head pulses in pain. The receptionist must be doing something elsewhere. I check a checkbox labelled "I Am Here" and uncheck the "I Am Elsewhere" one before clicking submit. The speakers are quietly playing "Buddy I Love You" by Tim the Little Lover Man, a simmering ballad of low volume passion. The room is empty. The overhead lights burn my eyes. I shake another Jubimum tablet out of the canister. I'll take up to three a <span class="t">*</span>day on the dire occasions.</Pp>
<Pp>A woman trudges through the side door in a grey legal gown. She has short black hair and looks very tired. That's not a critique of her appearance, she just seems truly fatigued. "Mr. 03Goldman...?"</Pp>
<Pp>I follow her into the halls of the legal nest. The walls are covered in strange, menacing items. I spot among them bloody knives, frayed ropes, poisonous flowers, rips of papper, handguns, shotguns, rifles, body parts, etc. "What's all this stuff from?"</Pp>
<Pp>"These walls are covered with objects involved in intra-office crimes...employees harming other employees mostly...usually small disputes...it is all dealt with internally."</Pp>
<Pp>I spy a grenade taped to the ceiling.</Pp>
<Pp>"Have you committed any other crimes...that would not show up on an exhaustive background check?...answer as best as you can." Her voice makes it sound like talking is an ordeal.</Pp>
<Pp>"That question kind of makes me feel weird. Is your job to defend me?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I need to make it clear...that I am not representing you in court. My job is only to ensure...that certain aspects of your employment contract with Dimples are upheld...also you will have to forgive me, I do not think I introduced myself...my name is Nera16 93Huszh."</Pp>
<Pp>"Nice to meet you. I'm Jim29."</Pp>
<Pp>"For the sake of full disclosure...you should know that I know exactly everything about you...I read about you all through the night."</Pp>
<Pp>"Is there that much to read?" The room is lit in a Jubimum glow.</Pp>
<Pp>"Please Mr. 03Goldman...no funny business...there is a lot of importance at work here, and the importance here is placed now on the facts." She looks at me the way one looks at a pedestrian blocking traffic.</Pp>
<Pp>"Have I committed a crime? You need to tell me. Even allegedly or whatever?? Does what I did count as manslaughter?"</Pp>
<Pp>She impassively gazes my way.</Pp>
<Pp>"Come on! Oh my God! Please tell me. I've been so so worried."</Pp>
<Pp>"The deaths resulting from your operational oversight are registered as 'corporate casualties'...which means you, along with Dimples at large, are protected from potential litigation...the courts will not judge you...the burden is strictly for your conscience to bear..."</Pp>
<Pp>This is excellent news. Really tremendous and wonderful for me to know. "OK. Alright, so what aspects of my contract are you concerned about me upholding?" Super great, wow. I happily scrape some drool crust off of my cheek.</Pp>
<Pp>"Let me just say it this way...you are at the center of a very, very, very large public relations dilemma...not good at all."</Pp>
<Pp>She opens the door to her office. It's positioned above the north play room. I watch through the floor as employees chuck inflated multicolor balls at each other. They're Amusement Studies interns. They're mostly sons and daughters of accomplished Dimples executives. Once they complete their internships they'll presumably be offered comfortable administrative roles. The glass floor is very thick but I can at least imagine their laughter.</Pp>
<Pp>"The bottom line, sir, is that you, to some extent...represent this company. We, as a corporate entity, and a dominant force in national trade, absolutely cannot let you cause any more damage to our dynamite brand identity. That would be NOT OK!! GOT THAT?...surely you must understand...that you will need to alter numerous elements of your lifestyle...to fulfill our requests."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah, mhm."</Pp>
<Pp>"Are you paying attention currently?"</Pp>
<Pp>I look up at her. My eyelids feel heavy. "Yah for sure, sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"This is very serious...you do not have time to watch them toss the balls..."</Pp>
<Pp>"Sorry, I'll admit I was watching but I  promise I was listening too."</Pp>
<Pp>"Here is the thing...people already know what you look like. They know what you did...they know oh 'Jim29? He is not a good guy'...some of them might want to hurt you with their hands, and that is just the way it goes..."</Pp>
<Pp>The vocalizations begin to sound more like screaming. I'm starting to feel fairly weird. My heart is racing. "I don't really understand what you're getting at."</Pp>
<Pp>"If you would just let me finish..."</Pp>
<Pp>"It really seems like you're just trying to make me feel scared."</Pp>
<Pp>"I am very sorry, that was not my intention...here is the deal...when you signed the employment contract you agreed to Article IX. Do you remember what that article entails?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I actually don't. They wouldn't let me read the contract."</Pp>
<Pp>"Article IX is an article which...to make a long story short...restricts how you represent the company, in this case...the company being Dimples." She really hammers the "D" sound each time she mentions Dimples. "You cannot disparage Dimples...you cannot criticize Dimples either...and most importantly I would say...you are not allowed to act in any way that reflects poorly on Dimples, OK?" Her eyes are pale blue. "Of course, one could argue that you have <em>already</em> reflected extremely poorly on the company..."</Pp>
<Pp>I feel a particular migraine spike on the right side of my head. "What do you need me to do?"</Pp>
<Pp>The glowing Market Megasphere passes through the evening sky behind her head and makes her face difficult to make out. "As it stands...your living and breathing poorly reflects on the company...you're very, very toxic, is I guess what I mean to explain. Your face...is synonymous with the death of innocent people. And as of right now, we can't just have you out and about...talking to other people...getting your hair cut...going to the Food Dome...seeing a rock &#x26; roll performance...blah blah blah, such things like that. Do not get me wrong...we're not going to kill you, god no, nuthin like that...we're just going to have to put you through some identity resculpting..."</Pp>
<Pp>She slides me a brochure. It's printed on heavy stock papper that has a plastic sheen. The design is modern and sleek. It outlines The Four Easy Steps to Resculpting Your Identity:</Pp>
<Pp>[[ These will have icons and diff formatting ]]</Pp>
<Pp>STEP ONE: NAME CHANGE</Pp>
<Pp><em>[the icon for this section is a quill drawing an X] </em></Pp>
<Pp>The first step of the identity resculpting process is to change your name. Make sure you pick a new name that you are very happy with! You will be given a new driver's license, passport, private security card, birth certificate, name badge, and shirt with your name screenprinted thanks to our partnership with ShirtDonkey. Try practicing that new name in the mirror tonight. Our Name Change team will personally burn all of your old identification materials. Good riddance!</Pp>
<Pp>STEP TWO: SOCIAL DELETE</Pp>
<Pp><em>[the icon for this section is a filing cabinet knocked over]</em></Pp>
<Pp>Next, we"ll run your old information through a script our Social Delete engineers cooked up that individually terminates each and every one of your social media accounts. All your drips, flips, drops, and flops, gone in a flash! We will generate new accounts for you under your new name using photographic images we render of your body and data we gather from your resculpting questionnaire. We'll work hard to make sure that your new accounts are a perfect fit for someone like you.</Pp>
<Pp>STEP THREE: FRIEND RESET</Pp>
<Pp><em>[the icon for this section is the recycling symbol with a person inside of it] </em></Pp>
<Pp>Your friends are going to wonder where you are. You can't tell them about any of this. They can't know that you still exist. You can send out your own custom final zoips to each of them individually, or you can use one of our award-winning final zoip templates. They might miss you, but it'll be fine in the long run. You're all going to forget about each other. And once you've executed a total Friend Reset, you can use our excellent FriendSearch zoftware (patent-pending) to meet new companions that are your age and living in your area. That shweet!</Pp>
<Pp>STEP FOUR: APPEARANCE SWAP</Pp>
<Pp><em>[the icon for this section is a trash can filled to the brim with clothes and stink lines float above it]</em></Pp>
<Pp>Last but certainly not least, you'll need to shake up your look. Studies estimate that by the age of twenty-five, two hundred thousand people remember what you look like. In order to finish your complete resculpting, our licensed Appearance Swap designers will give you a head-to-toe makeover so you look like no one ever. Welcome to your new you!</Pp>
<Pp>"FYI, we don't really do it in that order...we start with your appearance, and will work on the rest of it over the next couple of <span class="t">*</span>weeks...but that's an outline of how it works."</Pp>
<Pp>"You're serious?"</Pp>
<Pp>She slides a folder over to me. "Yes...this is not a comedy prank...this is standard procedure at all the great big companies these <span class="t">*</span>days."</Pp>
<Pp>I flip open the folder.</Pp>
<Pp>"Your new name was algorithmically generated to be stylish, funky, and 'totally you.' Your first name is now Bunndy...two n's...and your last name is Fludge. Your registration numbers are 22 and 35."</Pp>
<Pp>"Bunndy22 is my name now?" I pull out my birth certificate. Sure enough.</Pp>
<Pp>"It's short for Bunnson22."</Pp>
<Pp>"Interesting, I've never heard of someone named Bunnson." I lift up my new driver's license. The 3D portrait barely looks like me. My hand shakes.</Pp>
<Pp>"It's been a popular name...very handsome, and much lower registration number than you had before...virtually zero downsides in this fantastic deal...we also included your social media questionnaire underneath your new papperwork..."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can I request a different name?"</Pp>
<Pp>"No, sorry, much apologies...this name was generated specifically for you."</Pp>
<Pp>"Why would I ever want the name 'Bunndy22'? That's a name for an idiot."</Pp>
<Pp>"It's not up to you. It's up to the algorithm."</Pp>
<Pp>"You can't do this to me. This is insane."</Pp>
<Pp>"This is a new chance for you...you can start over." Her eyes don't move at all in her sockets. She just stares.</Pp>
<Pp>"But things were already OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"With all due respect, Mr. 35Fludge..."</Pp>
<Pp>"Shut the fnuck up."</Pp>
<Pp>"...with all due respect, Mr. 35Fludge," she pronounces with a strangulated groan, "this is inarguably charitable...if we were to fire you, no other company would hire you...and that is skipping over the fact that you have already broken our contract...you could never pay enough to fix what you caused..."</Pp>
<Pp>My blood swells in my veins. "I can't believe you're serious. I don't even know what to say." My stomach bubbles like a cauldron.</Pp>
<Pp>"I am sorry...you agreed to these terms..."</Pp>
<Pp>"SHE NEVER LET ME READ THEM!!! That can't be legally binding."</Pp>
<Pp>"Of course it can. Anything can be legally binding if you sign it with a quill."</Pp>
<Pp>I feel fluid push up through my throat. I turn over the side of the chair and retch a jet of warm chunky red vomit out of my mouth and onto the floor. Same color as Razzberry Queam. "I hate you. I hope you get ripped apart by wanderers." It burns in my esophagus and nose. "I hope they rip you apart and smear fresh putty in your wounds."</Pp>
<Pp>"You'll need to visit Mr. Glem22 21Ninkus, fourth floor, northeast quadrant...he is our in-house Appearance Swap designer..."</Pp>
<Pp>I don't say anything. I gag as some more red acid lurches past my tongue. Stringy drips of it hang from my lips. Silent for a few <span class="t">*</span>seconds.</Pp>
<Pp>"Sometimes I wonder what they think down there as they throw those colored balls back and forth...all <span class="t">*</span>day, they just throw them at each other...must be nice I imagine..."</Pp>
<Pp>I breathe in halting gasps. "Is Mr. 21Ninkus's door on the left or the right side?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It is at the very end..." She pushes her glasses up on her nose. "...I'm very sorry."</Pp>
