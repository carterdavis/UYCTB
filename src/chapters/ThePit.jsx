<p>When I saw light again I was floating. I dragged my arms through brackish lukewarm seafoam goo which smelled like powdered cumin. I was floating in a circular pool full of it. Pretty big pool. The fluid was about up to my nipples. My feet touched the ground. The interior stone walls of the pool stretched upward, I craned my neck back but it hurt. Far up on the outside rim a man gazed down at me. His smile was beaming and his face skin was sagging like it was melted. I couldn’t seem to find a ladder up and out. I felt very exposed. I couldn’t remember most of my fundamental knowledge. They must’ve disconnected my mindchip from my brain vein. I was wearing this thick white smock. It was heavy, must have sucked up a lot of the magenta fluid. Besides the smock I was nude.</p>
<p>I projected my voice. “Excuse me mister! Excuse me! Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>“Why yes I can. Nice to meet you. My name is Dumfrey52 45Kribbich.”</p>
<p>“Where am I?”</p>
<p>“My my. What a terrific question.”</p>
<p>“Can you answer it?”</p>
<p>“Why yes I can indeed. You are presently in the Soaking Pit.”</p>
<p>“How did I get here?”</p>
<p>“Boy oh boy. These queries are simply sensational. Very good things to establish. You were brought here by one of Mr. 01Stone’s men. He took a slide from the top floor.”</p>
<p>“Is there a ladder I can use to climb out of here?”</p>
<p>“Sadly no, there is not one that you can use.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on? I don’t remember anything. I don’t remember this smock at all. Did you take off all of my clothes? In order to get me in this smock?”</p>
<p>“Good heavens! How disgraceful! I would never. No, in fact a very sanitary machine removed your garments.”</p>
<p>“But where’d it put my garments? Give me back my clothes!”</p>
<p>“I cannot tell you yet. So sorry.”</p>
<p>“Come on! Oh my God! This is making me feel insane!”</p>
<p>“My most deepest apologies, but you will not have your garments back until you behave.”</p>
<p>“I am behaving!”</p>
<p>“No offense intended sir but I think I know quite a lot more about behavior than you do.”</p>
<p>“How can you know more about ‘behavior’? Everything that ever happens is a behavior.”</p>
<p>“Splendid. My only request is that from now on you please refrain from erroneously challenging my expert conclusions. OK? Does that work for you?”</p>
<p>“How am I not behaving? What have I ever done wrong? I’m a man with good intentions! I have a funny sense of humor and a vibrant inner world. Please let me go home!”</p>
<p>“I resent that I have to say this but, sadly, you will not exit the pit until you behave.”</p>
<p>“What is this fnucking goo? I feel sooo gross!! Oh my God!”</p>
<p>“It’s a special marinade. The King’s favorite recipe.”</p>
<p>“Can you PLEASE explain to me who this ‘King’ is?”</p>
<p>“He is so huge. Just enormous.”</p>
<p>“Wh-why is he big?”</p>
<p>“Because a King must be big. In addition, his skin is slimy and mauve. His lips are so rubbery and wet, and they’re so big that he barely has space to store them anywhere. He lives deep underground, takes a really long elevator ride to get down there. I have to bring his breakfast down every morning. He feasts on a large bag of gold, and then he pushes a healthy volume of putty into his very gigantic diaper. He—”</p>
<p>“Is this a prank teevee show or something?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry sir, but this is the absolute most realistic reality.”</p>
<p>“Jesus…um, and, why am I in The King’s sauce?”</p>
<p>“If you cannot behave, you will serve as The King’s afternoon treat.”</p>
<p>“I AM BEHAVING! I HAVE ALWAYS BEHAVED! PLEASE! OH MY GOD!!”</p>
<p>“I’m willing to compromise.”</p>
<p>“I DON’T WANT TO BE EATEN! PLEASE!! Get me out of here!!”</p>
<p>“I believe I can meet you in the middle. How does that sound?”</p>
<p>“PLEASE…sir…Jesus, holy fnuck. Oh my God.”</p>
<p>“If what you have said is true, and you have always behaved, then I will revise the bylaws of this seminar. Henceforth, according to the 19th clause of the King Needs Delicious Snack (Human) statute in the Dimples national legislature, you are the King’s yummy lunch until you <em>continue</em> to behave. Did you notice the subtle alteration? I added the word ‘continue,’ in homage to your previous behaving.”</p>
<p>“Uh. Yes.”</p>
<p>“Did you appreciate that? Is that more or less what you wanted?”</p>
<p>“No. Because it makes no sense.”</p>
<p>“Would you care to elaborate?”</p>
<p>“Nothing makes sense. This is just complete nightmare nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I actually think that might be true.”</p>
<p>Eventually I grew tired of pleading. My demands yielded answers to questions I didn’t ask which led to questions without answers, round and round, super stupid and tedious. I wanted to rip my hair out or scoop my eyeballs out and I just ran in circles round the pool until my legs crumpled. When that happened I just floated for awhile.</p>
<p>I’m using the past tenses because my mind chip got unplugged at some point and I couldn’t log stuff in the moment. This is all from biomemory, so it can be hard to keep all the details straight. Bear with me.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to teach you how to behave?”</p>
<p>I looked up. Dumfrey52 was still gazing down at me. He didn’t blink much. I stood up on my tiptoes.</p>
<p>“Please! I just want to go home!”</p>
<p>“Are you ready for your first behavior?”</p>
<p>“OK.”</p>
<p>“In order to behave, you must nibble your own toes.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I can do that. My legs aren’t that bendy.”</p>
<p>“You must behave!”</p>
<p>“I’m being honest! I would totally nibble my toes if I could.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever been in another creature’s belly? Besides your mother’s?”</p>
<p>“What kind of question is that?”</p>
<p>“You ever burn in the tummy acid? Get digested into nutrients? I don’t think it would feel very good, Mr. 35Fludge.”</p>
<p>“You’re being fnucked up. Why are you so disgusting? I hate the way your face sags down like a ballsack.”</p>
<p>“That is a highly immature comment to make.”</p>
<p>“I don’t get why I have to nibble my piggies. What’s the point. I can’t even do it. My body doesn’t work like that. I’m tired and hungry. How long have I been here?”</p>
<p>“You won’t know what time it is until you continue to behave.”</p>
<p>“I’m hungry! I feel weak!”</p>
<p>“You are permitted to drink the marinade.”</p>
<p>“No! It’s so salty! Give me food!”</p>
<p>“Are you ready for your second behavior?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Describe to me the sensations of how it would feel to kill your own best friend.”</p>
<p>“Why is that a good ‘behavior’? You’re jacked up in the head.”</p>
<p>“Do it. If you don’t do it you’re a moron.”</p>
<p>“NO! Fnuck! I hate you!”</p>
<p>“These two behaviors were designed to test your understanding of the first two precepts of The 01Stone Method.”</p>
<p>“I’m never going to read that book.”</p>
<p>“Precept 1 is ‘Embrace Indignity.’ Precept 2 is ‘Abandon Sympathy.’ You scored very poorly on each. Such a shame.”</p>
<p>“You’re not even giving me a chance. I feel like I’m at the mercy of some vicious, unknowable apparatus. I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to know the rest of the precepts?”</p>
<p>“Sure, might as well.”</p>
<p>“Precept 3 is ‘Savor Indulgence.’ Precept 4 is ‘Achieve Torment.’ Precept 5 is ‘Trust Death.’ If you can pass the final three behavioral exams, you’ll just barely make the grade at a 60% success rate.”</p>
<p>“And then I can go home?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Are you ready to Savor Indulgence?”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>Something plunked into the magenta goo. A big piece of taffy floated up to the surface.</p>
<p>“Eat this bonbon without chewing.”</p>

<p>I shoved it into my piehole. The taste was like Bananna mixed with armpit. I mushed it around with my tongue. My tongue didn’t have much space to move around. The taffy wasn’t getting much softer. Still very tough and rubbery. My belly felt so empty.</p>
<p>“Hah doo I shwallow? Wivout hooing? Doo big.”</p>
<p>“You have to swallow it.”</p>
<p>“DOO BIG!”</p>
<p>“Behave!”</p>
<p>“CANTH…DOO…BIG…”</p>
<p>“You are an URCHIN! Swallow!”</p>
<p>My throat constricted around the Indulgence. It lodged into my windpipe. I tried to cough or heave but I couldn’t. The pressure built in my lungs and my vision got blurry. I squeezed my neck frantically in hopes I could squeeze it out or something. Everything went black and I kept falling.</p>

<p>When I woke up I was still standing in the pool again. I felt woozy and numb. Hazy voices were talking. It was so dark. <div class="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/Calm Down Now.mp3" loop={true} bg="#3a264d" fg="#fef7a4" screenWidth={state.screenWidth} lyrics={(

  <p>You’re calming down so fast</p>
  <p>I love how this is going</p>
  <p>Aren’t we having a good time?</p>
  </div>
)} /></div> The room had been much brighter. I was nervous in the shadows. I felt my neck and there were spiky stitches running up and down my throat.</p>
<p>“What’s up with my throat?”</p>
<p>Dumfrey52: “I performed an emergency tracheotomy to keep you alive.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“The King prefers his snacks fresh, and not dead.”</p>
<p>“What’s the next behavior? What do you need me to do?”</p>
<p>“You failed miserably at Savoring Indulgence. There is no way you could pass the exam with your current score.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious? I swallowed it! How does that not count?”</p>
<p>“Not fully! Nope! Sorry, you did not swallow it fully. It did not make it all the way down your throat.”</p>
<p>“Go fnuck yourself! You are insane! GET ME OUT OF HERE! PLEASE!!!”</p>
<p>“From now on, focus on making yourself as delicious as possible. Think scrumptious thoughts. In addition, are you wearing any metal, jewelry for instance? The King hates the taste of metal that isn’t pure gold.”</p>
<p>“Don’t let him eat me. I’m begging you. I have three birds back in my cubby. They’re probably so worried. I don’t want them to starve. Please just let me go, I need to be back home, I need to, I need to go, oh my God, oh my GOD oh my goodness, oh my God…”</p>
<p>“I really do pity your situation. But the rules are the rules for reasonable reasons.”</p>
<p>“I just made putty.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I said I just made putty. Out of my rear.”</p>
<p>“Where did it go?”</p>
<p>I pointed at the brown blobs floating next to me.</p>
<p>“You disgusting rat. You just HAD to do it in the marinade. The King absolutely hates the taste of feces. This is a complete disaster.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I couldn’t help it. I’m so scared.”</p>
<p>“Well I’ll have to go down there and scoop it then. Let me go get my scooper. Don’t let it float anywhere else. I’m serious.”</p>
<p>“OK, OK. I won’t.”</p>
<p>He hurled a rope ladder over the wall and began his descent, gripping a miniature shovel in his big left glove. I stood perfectly still. He scurried down the ladder pretty fast. His saggy face dipped into the marinade. His watery eyes stared up at me before they focused in on my man mud island. My body went completely tense. He smelled much stinkier than I expected, even worse than my putty. He slid his shovel into the sauce below that brown log.</p>
<p> “This is just beyond depraved. Not in the marinade. What sort of person would—”</p>
<p>I smashed my knuckles into the back of his skull, he screamed, I shoved his head down into the fluid. He thrashed desperately, my muscles were hot coils igniting my limbs into furious motion. I kicked him as hard as I could and cracked my elbow against his neck vertebrae which I could feel snap cracking. His hair felt silky in my hands, I ripped some of it out. His rubbery torso wriggled and squirmed. I sunk my teeth into the back of his neck. Red warmth and the taste of iron. I kept gnawing and ripping as it gushed. I bit through tendons and veins, the cables and wiring, until his screams became whimpers. I licked my tongue deep into the wound and I dragged him by the hair up against the wall and bashed his skull against the concrete. Over and over, OVER and OVER, until the bone crunkled and out dripped some stinky grey sponge, and the blood dried beneath your fingernails and skin stuck between your teeth, you ripped out what was in there, all of him, even from long ago, birthdays, sunny vacations, notes in the lunchbox from mom, the first jokes he heard, the first songs he sung, the archived reflections of everyone he knew and anyone he could be, as stranger, friend, or family. Every perfect moment of joy and kindness and loving warmth he enjoyed crumbling grey between your fingers to drip drop into the salty slime, sploosh!</p>
