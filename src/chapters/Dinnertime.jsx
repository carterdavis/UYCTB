<Pp>I knock on their cubby door. The number is 4931W. The nameplate says Quimby31 11Nush. There’s some rustling behind the door. It swings open.</Pp>
<Pp>“Hey. What can I do for you?”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s me. Jim29.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Goodness gracious.” Their auburn hair hangs past their cheeks. The way their lip curls up when they see me makes me feel pretty bad. They’re wearing an apron that says “Cooking Currently.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m sorry that I look so weird.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Is all that permanent?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I think so.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Well, come on in!  You can put your shoes on the hanger to your right.”</Pp>
<Pp>There’s some ancient piano music playing through their speakers. The gentle twinkling keys are emphatic and flashy. I think the pianist just did a glissando? <div class="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/Solo Piano To Chill To.mp3" loop={true} bg="rgb(255, 199, 199)" fg="#000" /></div> I think that’s what a glissando is. They have so many paintings, mostly landscapes, hanging from the walls. Some of them are nature scenes, some of them are city scenes. “Heh,” I say, “You know what?”</Pp>
<Pp>“What?”</Pp>
<Pp>I smile my widest. “With songs and paintings like these, I’m starting to think life can’t be all that bad.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah, I guess. Could you shave some maize?”</Pp>
<Pp>I start shaving the maize. It’s an especially juicy cob. My eyes water. “Did you have a good <span class="t">*</span>day?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah! It was really nice. I did some exercise and chores, volunteered,” they make a huffing sigh, “signed some petitions, called my parents.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What sorta volunteering do you do?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I recently started helping at this non-profit called Kids Roll. I blow glass to make marbles for mid-income children. They love their marbles. It’s so fun using all the different colors and patterns. Sometimes I’ll use swirly black, grey, and brown so it looks like the planet.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Glass blowing sounds like it’d be pretty tricky to do.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’ve literally burned my knuckles so many times. It’s worth it, though, to see the looks on those kids’ faces, knowing that they’re going to get some marbles.”</Pp>
<Pp>I slice through the layers of juicy cob. “It would be cool to get a marble.”</Pp>
<Pp>“How’s that succulent doing? The one I sent you a few months ago?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I keep forgetting to water it, he he. It’s doin fine, since it’s plastic. I named it Genius.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah it did seem pretty smart come to think of it.” They crank the heat on the stove. “What was your <span class="t">*</span>day like?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t really want to talk about it.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Can you at least give me the short version then? You made me really worried.”</Pp>
<Pp>I’m at kind of a loss for words. “I don’t know if there’s a short version.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Your skin’s dark blue. You look like a freak of nature no offense. What happened to you?”</Pp>
<Pp>“If you must know…”</Pp>
<Pp>They nod largely.</Pp>
<Pp>“…Dimples backed me into a corner and I agreed to a bad contract. I’m currently being forced by the corporation I work for to abandon my whole life. Lots of people on the net want to hurt me badly. My face got forcibly rearranged in a horrible machine and my new name is Bunndy22.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Never met someone named that. Is it short for something?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yop, Bunnson22.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Dam. I’m really sorry to hear that.”</Pp>
<Pp>I look out the window. It’s still hailing. The buildings gleam like teeth in a wide dark mouth. “That’s just how it goes.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Does your face hurt?” They stare at me. Their gaze is piercingly studious. “It looks horrible.”</Pp>
<Pp>“That hurts my feelings. Please don’t say stuff like that. I had a bad <span class="t">*</span>day and I’m feeling sensitive.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m sorry, that makes sense, my bad.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Whole face feels really numb right now, like it’s someone else’s skin. It’s soo gross.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you have to wear that unisuit? And that wig?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I think so.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Were you able to fix that bug I’ve been hearing about?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah.”</Pp>
<Pp>“At least there’s that.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What do you think happens when we die?” I look in their eyes. “I don’t think I’ve ever asked you.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Hmm. In what sense? On a per-person basis?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah. Do you think it all just goes black? And the game’s over?”</Pp>
<Pp>They toss my slices in a pan with some sizzling lard. “I don’t even think it’d even be a black. More like no color at all.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Wait, so you think after life it’s just nuthin?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I mean, I’m not sure. I’m not making any conclusive claims.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you think there’s such a thing as hell?”  I rub my new forehead. “I’ve been worrying about it nonstop all <span class="t">*</span>day.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Well do you think there’s a heaven?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Just because there’s a hell doesn’t mean that there’s a heaven!!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Jim29, you have to settle down. You’re not going to burn in hell.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You’re right, I’m sorry.” I close my eyes and try to clear my mind again; no dice. “Sorry. Aah!! I’m being so weird.”</Pp>
<Pp>“No dude, it’s OK. Seems like you’re in a weird place.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Sometimes I get this problem where I start thinking about my breathing over and over. I have it right now. It’s like I get off rhythm. I take breaths too long or exhale too short or vice-a versa, you know.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Never heard of that.”  They reach into the oven and pull out a wide metallic tray supporting a syrup-drizzled scorched hog.</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah, it sucks really hard. I can’t figure out how to stop. The gas builds up in my belly and the pressure’s awful. The only way I can get it out is by burping and farting over and over. Breathing starts to feel like when you’re driving and you think about how you’re driving too deeply.” I pull in a long, slow breath. “You ever feel like that? Like in an instant the task seems impossibly hard and I’m definitely going to crash. I’ve been worried I’ll run out of air.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Your body takes care of that on it’s own. Is there anything that’d help you calm down? I have plenty of dizzy drink if you want some.”</Pp>
<Pp>I nod.</Pp>
<Pp>They fill up two glasses with the bubbly blue stuff and hand me one. “This stuff is called Extended Nipple Zap. Local recipe, pretty interesting flavor. Let me know what you think. I picked it up at the gulping den a few <span class="t">*</span>hours ago, and on the way out a hunched over old lady dropped a mitten. She was so grateful when I handed it back to her. She had such beautiful green eyes! I love cute moments like that. I’ve been thinking about how glad I was to be right there right then.”</Pp>
<Pp>“That’s cool.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What’s a nice thing that happened to you today?”</Pp>
<Pp>I burp. The drink is pretty strong. “I can’t think of anything.”</Pp>
<Pp>Earnestly: “Well, I’m really glad you’re right here right now.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Tight, tight.” I tap my fingers on the counter like I’m a drummer in a great band. “I feel totally hideous.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m sorry.”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s not your fault.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Are you hungry?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Mhm.”</Pp>
<Pp>They arrange huge hog chunks on beds of maize. I pull out my chair. The smells are sweet and savory. The hog face stares up at me. It’s grinning and looking real beaten up. Its four eye sockets are vacant, and the skin around them looks to have been blackened from some sort of impact. The stereo stopped playing music. It must’ve reached the end of the disc. My swollen plasticky lips are hard to open wide. “By the way, I can leave whenever you want me to.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What? No, you’re fine.”</Pp>
<Pp> “I’ve been having a really hard time being around people. It’s so hard for me to think of things to say.” I scrape a forkful of roasted meat out of the hog’s smiling mouth. Drips of fat slide down the edge my fork. “It’s as though I only think of garbage. I’m rotting—" (significant burp) “—inside my own brain.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Have you been attending your appointments with Dr. Kindbrain?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah, every other session or so.” I chew with vigor. Of course it tastes wonderful. Quimby31 makes great food.</Pp>
<Pp>“I think you should make your mental health a higher priority.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah yah, I know.” I pass a gentle toot from my rear. “Do you think this sweethog was laughing when it died?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Mm. Probably.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah. I think so too.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you like it?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Totally!  Was just about to say, delicious!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Terrific! I worked on it all <span class="t">*</span>day.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Your work really paid off.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Can I ask why your celly keeps vibrating?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Net weirdos found my info and keep dripping my number. Freaks have been calling me nonstop.”</Pp>
<Pp>“How do you know they’re freaks if you’re not answering? What if someone’s calling about something important?”</Pp>
<Pp>I pull it closer to my plate. “The first one I answered made me feel really scared. But I guess I can try answering this one.” I tap the green button and crank up the volume.</Pp>
<Pp>“Greetings?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Hey.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Could this be Mr. Jim29 03Goldman?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah, that’s me.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I go by the name of Boyce38 52Sminsel. Perhaps you’ve seen a few of my bylines?” His voice crackles with sass and verve. “I’m an esteemed journalist for an astonishingly important online journalism website called ‘Funny Laughs, Hot News, and Cool Trivia 🙂’. Ever heard of us?”</Pp>
<Pp>“For sure, absolutely! Wow.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m working hard on a very crucial piece about you, Mr. 03Goldman. Might you spare a <span class="t">*</span>minute to answer a few of my most important questions?”</Pp>
<Pp>I look up at Quimby31. “Would you mind if I take this?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No worries, you’re good.” They smile, a warm one.</Pp>
<Pp>I walk out of the cubby and stand in the hallway. I don’t feel comfortable talking on the celly near other people. “Hey! Sorry bout that. What were you wondering?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I suppose I’ll take it right from the top of the top. What’s your reaction to the last couple <span class="t">*</span>days?”</Pp>
<Pp>I lean my back against the wall. I think it’s important to pause and collect my thoughts.</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s been really hard. I’m honestly struggling to think of how to talk about it. I never meant for any of this to happen. My world’s been <em>very</em> topsy turvy. My feelings change from <span class="t">*</span>hour to <span class="t">*</span>hour, but mostly I feel really horrible. I’m trapped in a cage of despair and self-loathing. It’s a mistake I’ll regret for the rest of my life.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Hmm. Very interesting. Would you describe your reaction to the last couple <span class="t">*</span>days as being like Hubba Hubba😍, Whuzza Wha?😳, Yuck Machine🤢, Hellz Yes😎, or Fail Monkey🙈?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh…well…Fail Monkey🙈, I guess.”</Pp>
<Pp>“That makes sense. What do you think when people say you’re a murderer?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’d like to clear that up. These deaths are considered ‘corporate casualties,’ so I did not commit a crime. And even if I did, it isn’t my fault!! OK? Their machines just stopped keeping them alive. And, actually, hmm, I don’t know, is there any way you could just not print this answer, I’m just—"</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you think Whuzza Wha?😳 or Hubba Hubba😍?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh, right! I think Whuzza Wha?😳"</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you feel sorry for the families of the victims involved in this nightmare?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Hubba Hubba😍. Wait, I mean, Hellz Yes😎.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What’s your opinion on the rumors that this whole scandal was manufactured by the government to distract us from far worse news pouring in from the approximately eight hundred ongoing violent conflicts that our military is currently engaged in around the globe? And that you’re an actor under a fake name in a well-orchestrated hoax or possibly even some sort of artificially intelligent computering beastoid launched here through a psychic ripple in timespace?”</Pp>
<Pp>“What? Can you say that again?”</Pp>
<Pp>…</Pp>
<Pp>“I mean, either Whuzza Wha?😳 or Fail Monkey🙈 I guess. Was that real? Do lots of people think that?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Pineapple on pizza?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yuck Machine🤢.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Boxers, briefs, or panties?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Uh, boxers.”</Pp>
<Pp>“So Hubba Hubba😍 boxers?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah, I think so. By the way, if I gave you a statement on this whole thing, would you publish that? I just want to say sorry to the people I’ve hurt.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Hmm.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t want people to think I’m a monster.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Actually I think that’ll be enough, Mr. 03Goldman. Thank you for your time.”</Pp>
<Pp>I try to say “thank you, too” but he’s already hung up. I stand in the hallway for a moment and let my mind do a jumping jack or two. I’m starting to get a little dizzy.</Pp>
<Pp>Quimby31 is still sitting at the table and chewing. “That wasn’t long. How did it go?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t know.” I sit down and scoot my chair forward. “Probably OK.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Poured you another glass, just in case you want some more.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Thanks.” I take a sip and stare a hole in the table. I close my swollen eyes and tap the tines of my fork against my teeth. “The bug wasn’t my fault. I swear it wasn’t. There’s just so much code and it’s all written in this prehistoric language. It’s so impossible to understand.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Gotcha.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you believe me?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Why’s it impossible?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Imagine zooming in on a tiny particle of fructose with an electron microscope. There’s all those structures holding it together. Such a small thing is so meticulously structured, according to some ancient intention. Maybe if I could fully understand why those protons, neutrons, and electrons stick together in their special way I could eventually understand what makes em taste sweet. But I have deadlines, I need to make decisions, and like, things slip through the cracks. I can never be sure how my additions affect everywhere else in the system, but the unexpected is fatal.</Pp>
<Pp>“I keep pondering that kind of infinite vertical complexity, wondering how I fit into it. Is there any way I can? Massive designs poke through the clouds while I warm up my snacks down here so far below the heavens. Every waking moment demands such strenuous mature deliberation, but you can’t do the right thing because, I mean, every single thing that can be done is already inherently wrong. Every breath I take I’m sucking out of someone else’s lungs. Surviving some <span class="t">*</span>days feels like crawling around a big reconfiguring labyrinth on my belly. They take my gold and exhaust my body and make my commute to work longer all so they can develop more unique ways to blow people up hundreds of twentyleaps away. I got disfigured this afternoon and honestly, I’m doing pretty alright, from a statistical standpoint. I’m not bleeding out or thrashing in the water. I’m not scattered ash or stuffed under the mud.</Pp>
<Pp>“Every <span class="t">*</span>day I loosen the squeezing rope around my belly two other people’s ropes tighten. That’s one thing I’m sure of. I wish I could step somewhere that wasn’t also onto someone else’s head, you know? Every single choice any of us makes has a concrete effect on how many more or less people will die. But I only just know it as numbers even if I make the effort to read about it online. Every pair of eyes is a universe and if I consider even one of em shutting forever my brain feels like it’ll pop.</Pp>
<Pp>“You ever watch that evening program on TOTAL Access Channel 4? ‘Birth Rate/Death Rate’? The birth rate on the left is always faster than the death rate on the right, but not by much. The population count in the middle is always flickering, jumping a couple hundred, dropping a hundred, shooting back up again. I just imagine all those grown hearts stopping and all those new hearts starting. Gasping and crying in either circumstance. People sliding into life looking as bloody as they’ll leave it. It’s like, how many of those people were ready to leave? Did they get to say goodbye? I can’t help but laugh when I watch it. It makes me giggle and I feel like a sicko. Would it be better if I cried?</Pp>
<Pp>“And I know that none of this is new. Everything is really old, and speaking is wasting time. Which is why what I mean to say is, hmm, I don’t know. I don’t know about anything at all. If you think about anything enough it starts to seem impossible.”</Pp>
<Pp>Quimby31 claps their hands together twice really loud. “Wake up! You’re in a world of infinite flavor!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Isn’t that a big part of the problem?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I think it’s probably the only truly good thing left. Existence would be so meaningless if we knew everything or remembered anything. The gaps in our comprehensions are what make life worth breathing for.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Can you not talk about breathing if at all possible? I don’t want to get off rhythm again.”</Pp>
<Pp>“But do you get what I mean though? The sun feels a lot warmer in the nasty summer if you’d forgotten it over the nasty winter.” Their eyes are like flowers. “The world’s so endless that you could learn something special every <span class="t">*</span>day and still be a bit of a dummy. An enriched dummy!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Did you hear about the first Guns in the Sky launch the other <span class="t">*</span>day?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah.”</Pp>
<Pp>“So there are thousands of long guns now floating in space ready to blast us apart for whatever reason.”</Pp>
<Pp>“But they won’t be able to see us through the big black clouds.”</Pp>
<Pp>“The guns have lips. They can blow the clouds away.”</Pp>
<Pp>“But we keep learning! We know more now than we’ve ever known before. We have such an amazing collective potential for good. Every <span class="t">*</span>year we get kinder. We’re going to get where we need to go. And in the meantime we can listen to music and hang up paintings and water plants and cook meals and try our very best.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I just don’t think that’s logical. I don’t think there’s any evidence that things are getting better. I think that’s an invalid model we use to reassure ourselves.”</Pp>
<Pp>“God, shut up!” They set down their fork. “You can be such a snouch sometimes.”</Pp>
<Pp>“The sea levels are above our curbs and the storms keep getting worse as we irradiate the oil choked soil with new bigger bombs but I’m sure the folks getting incinerated right now in white hot light are very glad about how optimistic you are.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You get so much joy out of describing how bad it is, flexing the vocabulary. Like it’s exciting, like you’re the only one who’s ever realized it.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you believe me?”</Pp>
<Pp>“About what?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I asked you if you believed me earlier, that it wasn’t my fault, and you didn’t answer.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh, yah.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Come on. Do you believe me?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t know! I’m worried about you! Your face is all smashed up!”</Pp>
<Pp>I crush my glass straight into my face and feel it crunch into shards that split through the plastic cast and carve into my skin. I dig the shards in with my palm. “I GIVE UP!!!” Blood bubbles down over my eyes. I jab the cracked stem of the glass deep into my forehead until I can feel the skin break.</Pp>
<Pp>They stare at me.</Pp>
<Pp>I shout it again. “I GIVE UP!” My brain feels tight. “I just want to sleep. I just want to wake up where everything is different. I can’t stand being awake.”</Pp>
<Pp>They’re looking anywhere else.</Pp>
<Pp>“How productive is your line of thinking?” I point my finger right at them. “None of our toiling makes any progress. We eat, drink, and breathe poison every <span class="t">*</span>day. No one’s coming to our rescue. None of us are making it out alive.”</Pp>
<Pp>“The kids like it when I volunteer.”</Pp>
<Pp>I crawl down onto the floor and collapse in a heap. My face is soggy in a puddle of blood and tears. When I breathe the soupy mixture ripples. “I’m sorry. I’m being such a goblin.”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s OK.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I should stop it though.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah.”</Pp>
<Pp>“It is really cool that you volunteer.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Can you zoip me some netgold to pay for that glass you smashed?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Sure, no problem.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Also can you get up off of the floor? I don’t want you falling asleep there.”</Pp>
<Pp>I sit up on my butt and tease glass bits out of my facial skin. “I don’t want you to hate me.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t hate you.” They sit down next to me and run their fingers through my hair. “Promise.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Thank you for being so nice to me.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I want to make sure you’re OK.” They look me deep in the eyes.</Pp>
<Pp>“You’re good looking.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Nice, I think you are too.”</Pp>
<Pp>We grab each others’ faces and our tongues coil around like snakes. I can feel the wetness of their mouth and the smoothness of their teeth. They squeeze my ears and suck harder. Their neck is long and bony. I can feel its discs. I lick their face right on the cheek. They bite my nose.</Pp>
<Pp>I pull away. “Can we stop? I keep thinking about being crushed by an enormous hammer.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Of course. Dam. I’m sorry to hear that.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I think I’m just being dramatic.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t think any of this is your fault.”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s OK if you do.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I want to go outside.”</Pp>
<Pp>“OK, let’s go outside.”</Pp>
