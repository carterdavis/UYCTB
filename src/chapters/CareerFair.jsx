  <Pp>I never "intended" to work here. I ended up here.</Pp>
  <Pp>I went to an employment fair during my last *year at Knowledge Dome, about a *month before my ultimate review. I wasn't going to be graduating with a degree that clearly lent itself to work in any certain specific industry so I just wandered kinda listlessly past all the bright foam booths. It was a scorching hot nasty summer *day and the gymnasium was boiling damp. My nice grey unisuit was hanging in a closet in my grandma's house 50 twentyleaps north and I didn't have access to a speedster so I was wearing my least wrinkled button up tucked into my least baggy gym khakis. My hair was combed straight down and gelled into lumps and my bushy caterpillar moustache trimmed as best as I could. All the other kids were wearing their bright yellow interview shoes. My advisor forgot to forward me the form to order a pair.</Pp>
  <Pp>I was trying not to look interested in anything and actively figuring out creative reasons to not work for any of those companies. Deep down I felt profoundly incapable of contributing anything meaningful to my society or my world. Smart, thoughtful, talented, and kind-hearted as I may've been, I was also an arrogantly nervous dude filled to the brim with expensive, worthless, soon-to-be outdated ideas. The rest of the world seemed simultaneously so far above and beneath me.</Pp>
  <Pp>A tall woman with sharp eyes stood next to a glossy foam display. Her booth was adorned with a small bowl of violet candy corn and branded pens in a range of calming pastel hues. There was a black box plugged into the wall projecting a hologram of their logo spinning. It was a faded pink D with a baby blue dot in its center. It glowed a little bit too bright.</Pp>
  <Pp>"We just recently updated our logo. Do you like it?" She wore a gold pendant in the shape of a pouncing panther. Her smile was wide and impressive.</Pp>
  <Pp>"Yah, I think it's very striking." I looked up at her and then to the side.</Pp>
  <Pp>"Nice to meet you, Jim29 03Goldman! My name is Veronica72 97Snoat." She had dark crispy hair. "I've read all about you on the net."</Pp>
  <Pp>We scanned each other's finger data. Her hand was very large and could wrap fully around mine. There was an unmistakable tenderness in her eyes and I felt unnerved looking into them as her fingerprints downloaded onto my mindchip. I stuffed my hands into my pouch immediately afterward. "Uh, so what sort of work do you do at Dimples?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"I see you didn't do your homework!" She smiled and rubbed her lips together. She had made her voice big and loud, like a humorous voice. "We're an enormous medical technology company."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Like for records? Book-keeping, and stuff?"</Pp>
  <Pp>She leaned her head from side to side. "Close," she widened her eyes, like I really was very close, "but actually hmm...no cigar. We sell a monthly subscriptional program that nearly every medical device in the nation runs on." She handed me a pink folder with a blue pamphlet inside.</Pp>
  <Pp>"How does that all work?"</Pp>
  <Pp>She had long eyelashes and deep wrinkles around her smile lines. "The devices we support are 'smart' and completely net-enabled. We design their functionality and user interfaces. When people get sick, their well-being becomes our responsibility. Do you want to save someone's life, Jim29?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"Yah, sure."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Good. Cuz we save the lives of billions of people every *day."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Cool. That's super awesome." The bottoms of my brown dress shoes felt sticky against the floor. I kept stealing glances over at the hologram. "So do the devices have, like, extra functionality cuz of the zoftware?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"Certainly. All of our devices are locked into an invisible, 'global' network that spans coast to coast. Even though the zoftware is buried deep down in the hard drives of the machines, they're able to communicate with each other from very far away."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Gotcha, OK. So they're like, online?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"Yes. Patients are also given the choice to instantly publish the results of their procedures on social media, for instance."</Pp>
  <Pp>I flipped through the pamphlet. It had a very minimal design. The papper was thick and smooth, kind of leathery. "What languages do you use? I don't have a lot of experience."</Pp>
  <Pp>"We use immutable Tangle 40.0.3 for our back end programming. The interface is all written in our special version of FlashScript. We call it DimpleScript, he he!" She furiously scribbled on her notepad. The friction made a squealy scratching sound.</Pp>
  <Pp>"Is it OK if I haven't done much programming? I only used a little bit of FlashScript in one of my microlessons."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Yes! Why are you underselling yourself?" For a fraction of a *second her eyes bored through mine, deep into my sensitive noodle brain. But then she smiled. "I'm sure you'll get the hang of it. You'll pick it up quick. You're a star, Jim29! We're looking for people just like you."</Pp>
  <Pp>The interview process was relatively painless. I can't really complain. In my first interview they made me wear a weighted vest like you wear when they snap images of your bones and they tested to see how quickly I could escape a maze. In my second interview they made me wear a blindfold and took me underground and had me answer questions about my personality in the middle of what sounded like a large empty stadium. I really didn't enjoy hearing my wispy voice echo back to me off the walls of that cavernous interior. I got an offer the next Activeday.</Pp>
