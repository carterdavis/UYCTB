<Pp>The suction spits us out in a cavernous globular room. The walls curl in sort of like a split spheroid or the bend of a human kidney. Magnificent glass windows span the outer perimeter, drinking in the ample late morning glow. Wonder how come they’re not tinted red like the rest of em. The rug underfoot is plush and shag, the same grey shade as the nighttime sky. The walls are adorned with a tessellated pattern of a cat digging its claws into a mouse’s back.  The entire surface of Augustinius00 01Stone’s big honking desk is an digital display lit with bright Ultradef data. The graphs and charts flip and zoom around. There is no sign of the man himself.</Pp>
<Pp> Grabbus clears his throat. “Wait here. Mr. 01Stone will be with you shortly.”</Pp>
<Pp>I sit in a furry chair opposite the desk. It doesn’t feel like actual animal fur, but I suppose it could be the fur of a hypothetical creature. The room temperature is perfect, just warm enough to be noticeable. Grabbus keeps clearing his throat. I didn’t expect him to stay in the room with me. The <span class="t">*</span>minutes are feeling stretched, but it’s kind of seeming like there was more than enough time for me to plug my celly in to charge, you know?</Pp>
<Pp>A rectangular passage melts out of the right-hand wall. Mr. 01Stone enters with a loping gait. “Howdy Bunndy22! My deepest apologies! I did not mean to keep you waiting.” He’s way taller than I expected. His entire upper torso is soaked in viscous yellow fluid. Big glops of it drip to the floor. “Grabbus? Could you fetch me my rag? I need to wipe down.”</Pp>
<Pp>I smile like a professional. “Uh, so what’s that goop? If you don’t mind me asking?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Ah, yes. I just got back from a meeting with The King. When he gets excited, things get slobbery. I hope you don’t mind.”</Pp>

<Pp>“That’s OK. Who’s ‘The King’?”</Pp>
<Pp>“He’s who we’re doing all this for. Would you like a beverage by chance? Or a snack perhaps?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No I’m good without, thanks though.”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s my pleasure. God I love looking at all this information.” He’s pointing at his desk screen. “These figures are my entire earthly existence.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah they look fairly impressive.”</Pp>
<Pp>Grabbus hands him a fresh white towel. He dabs it across his spacious forehead. “Yes. Very much so indeed. Gosh. Alright.” He rustles it through his fluffy hair. “I have so much to discuss with you, buster. Where to begin, where to begin, where to begin…” He scrapes it across his broad shoulders. “I suppose at the beginning! Bunndy22, what was your beginning?” He crumples the mustard-colored cloth into a ball and tosses it on the floor.</Pp>
<Pp>“Hmm. How far back do you want me to go? I’ve been around for twenty-four <span class="t">*</span>years.”</Pp>
<Pp>“How was your childhood?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I think I remember it being pretty good.”</Pp>
<Pp>“And your parents?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah they were really good. Loved them. But they died in a speedster accident before I was old enough to understand much.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Wow. Really?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Mhm.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Going through an experience like that, you must’ve built a lot of character.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t know…I haven’t really thought about it like that.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Have you read <em>The 01Stone Method</em>?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Been meaning to. Haven’t gotten around to it.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh you really should. The fourth chapter is all about this topic.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Which topic?”</Pp>
<Pp>“The Benefits of Tragedy.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m not sure there are any.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You wouldn’t be the high-quality man you are today if you also had living parents.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m sorry Mr. 01Stone, but I just really disagree.”</Pp>
<Pp>He chuckles to himself. “Heh heh, yah. All I’m saying is, you clearly have not read the book. Because you have a lot to learn, champ!”</Pp>
<Pp>“What did you want to talk to me about?”</Pp>
<Pp>“We’ll get to that. I have a few more questions.”</Pp>
<Pp>“OK.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you think it feels good to hurt people?”</Pp>
<Pp>“What kind of question is that?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No. Of course not.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You will someday.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh…Hm. What—”</Pp>
<Pp>“You think I’m being serious?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I honestly don’t know.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Do you, by chance, happen to live according to a specific moral creed?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’d say the ten commandments mostly.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes. That is very helpful.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m sorry sir but I have a meeting in twenty <span class="t">*</span>minutes, if you could—”</Pp>
<Pp>“No you don’t. You don’t have any meetings today.” He swipes his fingers across his desk to expand and tilt a three-dimensional diagrammatic prism of my schedule for this <span class="t">*</span>week.</Pp>
<Pp>“I guess I must’ve gotten mixed up. Sorry.”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s no big deal. Relax! We’re friends, dude. Boo-yah!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah. For sure. You have a really beautiful office up here.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Why thank you!” He does a small curtsy. “It’s a delight to finally meet you in person. I’ve been hearing your names so often. A lot of people have been talking about what you supposedly did!”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m so sorry—”</Pp>
<Pp>“No! It’s a good thing! Remember what we were just talking about?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Morality?”</Pp>
<Pp>“The Benefits of Tragedy!”</Pp>
<Pp>“OK. Yah.”</Pp>
<Pp>“After your bug made those two randoms croak, you reaped some serious benefits.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I did?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah! You got a complete makeover, and you look stunning. You got a brand new unisuit, which I don’t see you wearing I might add. Your brand new name is algorithmically certified one of the best names that were available. And on top of all that, you get to talk to the CEO of your company!”</Pp>
<Pp>“C’mon man. That’s irrelevant. That’ll never offset the actual cost.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What cost?”</Pp>
<Pp>“What?”</Pp>
<Pp>“What cost are you talking about?”</Pp>
<Pp>“The cost of…death? Loss of life?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Every person that is dead deserved to die.”</Pp>
<Pp>“No.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes! Even our Abrahamic God agrees with me! Every death is a part of his plan! You don’t get your fried chicken cubes without slitting a few chicken throats.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Am I the throat slitter in this analogy?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No! I am!”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t think I’m keeping up with this conversation.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You’re doing great, great job so far…I have another question for you—”</Pp>
<Pp>“Please Mr. 01Stone. I’m having a hard <span class="t">*</span>day. Can you tell me what’s going on?”</Pp>
<Pp>“You’re having a hard <span class="t">*</span>day?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What’s made it hard so far? The crash?”</Pp>
<Pp>“How do you know about that?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Tulip’s death report flashed across my screen this morning. It sounded very sad when it realized it was dying.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m sad that I killed it.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Ha ha ha. Whatever.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Whatever?”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s a dumb thing to feel sad about.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I think you might be acting a little callous.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Whooops. My bad.”</Pp>
<Pp>“OK. I don’t get why you’re smiling.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You’re clearly much sadder about your compromised mode of transportation than you are about those actual former living people. Whereas like a <span class="t">*</span>minute ago: ‘The cost of…DEATH? Loss of LIFE??’ Ha ha. Isn’t that weird?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Seriously, can I leave? I have a lot to do today.”</Pp>
<Pp>“No, no, no! God, a thousand times NO! You are legally required to be here.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Really?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes. Per your contract.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I am legally required to be in this room?”</Pp>
<Pp>“During Business Time, when you set foot into the Dimples Nation, you become a Dimples citizen.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Dimples is a sovereign state?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yop.”</Pp>
<Pp>“How is that possible?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Provision 47d of the Corporate Nationhood Act. Went into effect last nasty winter.”</Pp>
<Pp>“OK! Fine. I’ll stay here.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes you will. So the thing I was getting at earlier is—”</Pp>
<Pp>“But I don’t have to listen to you.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes you do.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Really??”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes contractually you are required to ‘perk your ears up.’ Codex II, Appendix B, Line 92, if you intend to verify.”</Pp>
<Pp>“How could I verify that? No one has ever let me look at my contract.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Anyway the thing I was getting at is that people like you are so darn inconsistent.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Gotcha gotcha. How so?”</Pp>
<Pp>“You perform grief for the national community but you’re really only concerned for your tribe. You don’t care about anyone you don’t know. Their deaths hold no meaning to you. And here’s the thing, I’m saying that’s normal!”</Pp>
<Pp>“I object to the assumptions you’re making about my feelings. I think I’m actually a pretty caring guy.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Well that’s really cool then. Heh. I’m not!! Why care, ya know? No one’s paying me to care. For instance, a few <span class="t">*</span>weeks ago I got some devs to whip up a secret Dimples feature to offer discounted ‘Minimalist Dosages,’ the concept being: as your body recovers, you need less medicine, so you get a lower dosage. But if you get a lower dosage, your body’ll never fully recover, so you get nice and sick again. Pretty simple. This way, theoretically, we can retain you as a customer indefinitely, and keep you reliant on our suite of premium products. Which means more gold for us to invest in our corporation and feed to The King!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Who is The King? You never answered. Oh and, is that actual functionality in our code?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes! And it works great, initially. But the algorithm is vicious. He’s greedy, and he’s hungry, and he’s naughty. He keeps sucking down dosages, spitting out lower and lower values, yummy yummy! He’s eating so fast he can’t help but burp and belch! In a couple cases, he even gobbled those digits into twisted primordial ratios. Long story short, there were miserable consequences.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Wait, is the algorithm’s state stored in CURVE_QUOTIENT?”</Pp>
<Pp>“There’s that delicious Dimples intellect! Skipping ahead already. Well OK then, so this malfunction pops up in two machines out of fifty trillion, and these people, these ‘earnest’ and ‘sensitive’ people like you, they all freak out, there’s a public outcry y’know, so we need to defuse the situation. So my good friend Grabbus and I boot up the computerior to see who edited the tangle in the region where the crash happened. Next, we use this excellent zoftware program called Friend Analyzer, patents pending, to determine which of the tangle file’s recent editors has the fewest companions and admirers; someone who’d be missed the least. And in this case, the Friend Analysis picked lucky Mr. Bunndy22. So we send a notification down the chain of command that it’s completely broken and seems like it’s all his fault.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Are you fnucking serious? I didn’t even cause the crash?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Don’t use that kind of language with me. I’m being very honest and friendly. A story like that could bring down Dimples. So we had to sacrifice you on behalf of our gorgeous brand. You gave the public a face to loathe and spit on. That’s noble, dude. You enabled their catharsis and helped them heal. And as a reward, you got a brand new face! Whoa! I just think that’s so dam cool. Gives me goosebumps. Wanna see em?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Don’t show me your fnuckin bumps. You’re a sociopath.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Ah, name calling. Very mature of you.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Also what was all that about the discount dosages? That sounds completely despicable.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Hey, don’t blame me. The customers get to make that choice. They can keep that extra bit of gold and use it to buy a few gooshburgers or whatever. Some of our customers live in sludge. They prowl the dumps for anything edible. I’m serious! Given a choice between treatment for their nostril gonorrhea or a fried beef sandwich, they’ll always take the sandwich. One hundred and fifty percent of the time.” His restless eyes dart around. “Y’know why? Because their lives already ended the <span class="t">*</span>second they were born. Ever since they’ve cranked away at their empty labor like diseased mules, subconsciously begging for the merciful release of nonbeing. And you want to tell me those are people? They don’t even have entrepreneurial aspirations!”</Pp>
<Pp>“It sounds like you’re just a really, really bad person. Maybe you should consider cyber therapy or something.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Please trust me, Bunndy22. I am much more intelligent than you. I know better. Those are animals. They’re meant to be farmed. God never wanted them to exist. Their lives are demonstrably less real than yours or mine.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Your ideas are literally zigzog.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Curious. Are you one of the fifteen richest men in the nation? Because I’m number twelve.”</Pp>
<Pp>“How is that a response to what I said?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Are you one of the fifteen richest men in the nation? Answer me first. Are you?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No, because I’m not a messed up freak.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What do you think when you watch ants crawl around? Do you observe a clear moral code? Or do you think ants are amoral? They regularly eat their own.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t want to act like an ant.”</Pp>
<Pp>“The ant is perfect! The ant creates and the ant conquers! He is a fine-tuned engine of righteous aggression, and one <span class="t">*</span>day he will consume you! You, my friend, are lazy and soggy with feeling. You’re getting in your own way. It’s sad to watch.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Why would I ever listen to your advice? You ruined my entire life.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What life? You had, what, ONE friend? A cramped, rotten cubby? Seems miserable.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Of course it was miserable. Everything is miserable.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yes! So why not act like an ant?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Cuz God made us humans.”</Pp>
<Pp>“There’s no such thing as a human. We’re all ants, big fleshy ants. The sad reality is, some of us appear to have lost that determination, that intensity, given to us by God. Those people, and by that I mean the people like you, are all gonna die out. Unless, of course, you all read my book <em>The 01Stone Method</em>.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m never going to read your garbage book.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Come on! It’s good! I think it would teach you some really valuable lessons. I’m sincerely trying to help you right now. We got a zoip from Tulip the other <span class="t">*</span>day, boo hoo hoo, may it rest in peace. It was very worried about you. It said you were using your decomissioned name. Jim__ __Goldman.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Jesus Christ. Tulip actually contacted you? That thing was <em>such</em> a booger.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You breached our contract. Plain and simple. We’re going to have to punish you.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You don’t decide who I am.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Where is all this obstinance coming from? You’re acting juvenile.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Fnuck you. I hope your penis gets ripped off.”</Pp>
<Pp>“What are you doing? Do you want me to kill you? I’ll smash your brains out.”</Pp>
<Pp>“OH MY GOD! Ha ha!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Is something funny?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No, I just feel like I’m in Hell. Please let me go.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I would not hesitate to smash your brains out with a hammer. I really do mean that. Got it? So shut your little rat mouth. You are nothing. You’re less than nothing, you’re slime. No one on this entire fnucking planet cares about you. You’re a parasite, a barnacle, wasting away in front of us. A joke we can all enjoy.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Bash my brains out, you weirdo. Do what you have to do. I don’t know. You seem to be tangled up in this power stuff. Just keep in mind that my celly’s been recording audio in my pouch this entire time. It’s broadcasting this whole chittychat out as a drip.”</Pp>
<Pp>“AH! Alright. That’s, hmm. Please show me.”</Pp>
<Pp>“This is in the public record now. People know that I’m alive, that I’m innocent, everything. Let me leave. I just want to go home.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Prove it. Show me your celly.”</Pp>
<Pp>“But it’s in my pouch.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Then remove it from your pouch. Now.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah. OK. H-here, let me get it out. One <span class="t">*</span>second. Oh…Darn. The battery must have just died. It broadcasted everything up until now though.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Wouldn’t there be an alert on my deskscreen? My Drip account is sipped onto yours.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh. Hmm. Drip must be having some server outages.”</Pp>
<Pp>A throat clears behind me.</Pp>
<Pp>“This is the end of our conversation, Bunndy22. I don’t appreciate your attempt to trick me. You need to learn how to behave.”</Pp>
<Pp>Huge clammy palm rubs against my neck. The fingers push into my hair.</Pp>
<Pp>“I will pray for you.”</Pp>
<Pp>They clench and yank me upwards by the skull. My neck stings taut like it’s going to rip. Grabbus grunts and thrusts me headfirst down into the shag carpet. The grey fibers aren’t nearly plush enough to cushion my descent. My nose crunches and the thudding crack of skeleton against concrete is almost pronounceable. My front teeth crunch. Blood gushes into my field of vision. I gag on something in the throat before I’m yanked up by my hair once more, and smashed once more against the ground, feeling my face give way, erupting, warm onto myself enough to melt the vision into void.</Pp>
