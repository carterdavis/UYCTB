<Z d={1} u="j56">jumper56ok : will you be available to help me with that DisequalizedIntToInt error?</Z>
<Z d={15} u="j29">funguyjim29 : yah I can after morning chat</Z>
<Pp>I crinkle my eye with my fist. I take my cushioned programming gloves off. I yank my umbilical data plug out of my computerior and click it into my celly's corresponding UDP port. I build up enough saliva to secure my computerior with my Dimples SpitLock. I slurp down the last gooey droplets of my vitamin-enriched Sunrise Breakfast Queam.</Pp>
<Pp>Dimples employees are required to attend Morning Chat every *day at 10:00bt. A blue slide on every floor pours down into the basement auditorium. CEO Augustinius00 01Stone gives a speech for all of the employees. It generally lasts around five *minutes.</Pp>
<Pp>I climb into the fifth floor basement slide. "Ch-ching!" Must've been scrubbed recently, the plastic is still really slick. It has a steep slope so it can pick up enough speed to clear a tight loop-de-loop. Makes my stomach lurch.</Pp>
<Z d={20} u="j56">jumper56ok : ok thanks</Z>
<Z d={27} u="j56">~ : I've been stuck on it for *hours, ha ha</Z>
<Pp>I work through the three factor authentication process to sign into the auditorium. Fifty rows of bleachers wrap around a raised stage. People pack into the seating space, wedged booty to booty. I sit on the south side of the nineteenth row. White stadium lights blare against the black walls. The bleachers are a little too shallow, and my legs don't fit very comfortably. I scrunch up and cover my eyes to shut out the glare.</Pp>
<Pp>Mr. 01Stone walks onstage two *minutes after 10. He's always the exact same amount of late. He wears a navy unisuit that clings to his muscular frame. The watch on his right wrist is gold and his left wrist silver. I love his smile. It's so confident and casual. He has such a confident, brassy personality. He looks in his mid-forties. I like to hear him talk.</Pp>
<Pp>A colossal hologram of his head appears in the air above the stage. I haven't figured out where it's being projected from. As Augustinius00 talks and smiles, the head mimics his every movement and makes eye contact with me regardless of where I'm sitting or how my face is angled. Apparently makes eye contact with everyone else too. His jaw is angular, his hair slicked back and brown, his eyes glowing and kind.</Pp>
<Pp>"Good morning, Dimplers! Can you give me a Respectfulday Boo-yah?" The speakers boom with Augustinius00's thick voice. His vowels reverberates cavernously.</Pp>
<Pp>The bleachers roar.</Pp>
<Pp>"Let's make this weekend special, alright? Boo-yah! But first, we've got a *day of hard work ahead of us. And I think we can make this *day special.</Pp>
<Pp>"Our company has been swelling up like a balloon. Seriously, you know I'm not trying to make you laugh right now. It really has been. This was a great *month for us. We added so much more gold to our company goldpit. We hired a thousand new people. And believe it or not, they're learning. They're growing. They're taking risks. Christ, it's inspiring."</Pp>
<Pp>The room erupts in applause. The hologram freezes for a split *second before resuming speech.</Pp>
<Pp>"You guys are so sweet. You're like gumdrops. I want to see what you can do! I want to see what you can achieve! You've got the light of God in you!" On stage he jumps a leap and a half in the air, pumping his fists. The room roars.</Pp>
<Pp>A guy sitting next to me is smiling wide. He mutters and whispers to himself. Every few *minutes he pounds the bleachers with his hands.</Pp>
<Pp>"I'll be honest with you gumdrops though. Yesterday was not a good one. No, not good at all. Sorry, but it wasn't. We have fun here at Dimples. You guys all know that. But we also need to be accountable. Our code is used by many people for many important reasons. A daddy tripped and fell on the concrete, needs an x-ray. That x-ray machine runs on pure Dimples zoftware. A mommy cut the top of her thumb off. The surgeons are gonna fire up a suite of tools that rely on the amazing work we do here at Dimples. A baby got his hands on some poison, thought it was a candy treat. What's his itty bitty wittle tummy pumped wif? You're all so smart, you know what I'm going to say, I don't even have to say it.</Pp>
<Pp> "That's not to say today's not going to be a blast! I love Respectfuldays, and I hope you do too. But the fact of the matter is that our code was involved in the deaths of two people. One of our engineers created a bug that led to two fatal crashes. I'm not going to say their name. Their name does not deserve to be spoken. We're trying to figure out who it was who did it, actually. And if you know who it was you can send us an anonymous tip."</Pp>
<Pp>The auditorium is silent. My stomach feels full of acid bubbles. The guy sitting next to me cups his hand over his mouth in surprise.</Pp>
<Pp>"When I first founded this company twenty-four *years ago, I wanted to make a difference. My blood ran hot with inspiration and ingenuity. I got into medical technology because there's nuthin more important than people. Nuthin more important than guys and gals. And if I could just..."</Pp>
<Pp>His giant hologram eyes are closed and his smile is wide. He's motionless for at least ten *seconds.</Pp>
<Pp>"When I think about those two folks it makes me sick deep down in my tummy. I don't have much more to say. We're getting ripped apart in the news. I honestly can't stand to see it. It makes me want to launch myself into outer space.</Pp>
<Pp>"Listen, I'm sorry friends. I lost my cool. We must let go of the life we have planned so as to accept the one that is waiting for us. The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present. Have a happy Respectfulday, my little gumdrops."</Pp>
