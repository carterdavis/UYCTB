<Z d={1} u="">: I'm sorry for not responding last night</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I hope you didn't take it personally</Pp>
<Pp>The bug reports describe the error as an IMPOSSIBLE_DIGITS exception for the variable CURVE_QUOTIENT. It occurred on line 495 of intensity-and-dosage.tangle, one of the largest files in the Dimples library. I triple click and highlight the whole line:</Pp>
<Pp>UNFRACTIONATE(0 ≥ STATE[PHARMA[CURVE_QUOTIENT]] ≤ 1);</Pp>
<Pp>We just recently started using Dominators in Tangle. I don't really understand them. The zoips keep zipping through my umbilical data plug straight into my mindchip.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: alright sorry, but now two other values are disequalized</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: 5 to 9? i think</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm sorry, I'll get back to you</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: but right now isn't a very good time</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I hope work has been better for you today!</Pp>
<Pp>Dominators have to do with dynamic value control across equality networks. Some objects carry invalid values (informally referred to as "naughty data" at Dimples) that need to be dominated and restricted from proliferating through their multivaluation chains. For instance:</Pp>
<Pp>IF [NAUGHTY[CURVE_QUOTIENT]]!!:</Pp>
<Pp>CURVE_QUOTIENT === DOMINATE[CURVE_QUOTIENT, TRUE]</Pp>
<Pp>is the sort of line I'm searching for. I press the spacebar five times.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: would you be available to do something this *weekend??</Pp>
<Pp>My back feels sweaty against the chair. Nug20 sends me a zoip.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: How's progress on that hotfix man? We need that up tonight</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: Otherwise we have to postpone until Loyalday</Pp>
<Pp>I can't figure out why CURVE_QUOTIENT needs to be dominated. I'm trying to find examples of where else it's being used, for context. My search isn't yielding any results.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: ohh i guess one of the variables is just in a public knob. i thought it was private.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: Can you give me a solid estimate on how roughly long it'll take?</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm making progress on it right now</Pp>
<Pp>My right knee twitches. Humph. I type out another zoip but leave it sitting in the bar. I can feel a migraine coming on. A little glowing dot burns in my vision.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I can't keep making excuses on your behalf. Please tell me</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: that didn't fix anything though. hmm</Pp>
<Pp>I minimize my editor. The electrocardiogram window from yesterday is still open.</Pp>
<Pp>"Ch-ching!"</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm sorry, i don't mean to bother you. just let me know if you have any ideas! :~X</Pp>
<Pp>It flatlined. I close the window. If I can't trace the value of CURVE_QUOTIENT anywhere else then I can't determine why the data was naughty. It's common to find variables misdefined elsewhere in some other file, but generally a quick search comes up with those specific lines. I guzzle a thick gulp of Plumm Queam.</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: I'm filling out the code submission form for you so you can just upload it</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: as soon as you're done</Pp>
<Pp>I scroll through topics in the Dominator documentation. It's filled with links so I can learn the ins and outs of Domination. The migraine dot in my vision glows violet. It grew hands. I squint to read the text on the screen.</Pp>
<Pp>"Ch-ching!"</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: have to be honest Nug20 I am feeling pretty crummy right now</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: No time for that. Finish it</Pp>
<Z d={1} u="">: It's starting to smell pretty tangy in here!</Pp>
<Pp>I yank the data plug right out of my belly button. It's warm from use. The chatter drains out of my consciousness. I can focus regularly again.</Pp>
<Pp>I run some commands in a debug console. CURVE_QUOTIENT isn't visible in the intensity-and-dosage scope. I rub my right temple in slow circles. The light from overhead is so bright. I hear the ding dong of a Drip notification. I haven't gotten a Drip notification in months.</Pp>
<Pp>@3145948352 > EXPOSED: Dimples employee Jim29 03Goldman ([Mr Jim29 That'sme((]) reported as architect of zoftware crash that mercilessly slaughtered two</Pp>
<Pp>The drip already has ten thousand thumbs and four thousand flips. My eyes are blurry and my face is wet. Jittery energy pumps behind my brain. My throat pushes into my mouth.</Pp>
<Pp>@6276441179 > @3145948352 > disgusting</Pp>
<Pp>I skim through the code. Click between the tabs. Highlight letters, words, lines. I close my eyelids and sit in the dark. My head throbs throughout the room. I take short, quick breaths.</Pp>
<Pp>@14923567215 > [Mr Jim29 That'sme((] > worthless human being</Pp>
<Pp>@74629464215 > [Mr Jim29 That'sme((] > wish i could slit your throat myself</Pp>
<Pp>My celly buzzes around frantically on my desk from all of the notifications it's getting. It's already 2:00bt. My mind can't settle on any certain thought. I swallow air wrong and cough.</Pp>
<Pp>@84038204819 > [Mr Jim29 That'sme((] > Local harlots BEGGING to be your date! -- Click here for the sexy new adventure. tttp://h.ot/19489A9</Pp>
<Pp>"Ch-ching! Ch-ching!"</Pp>
<Pp>The fuzzy cash register noise blares through the speaker hanging above my desk. It doesn't have an on/off switch, it protrudes out of the wall. I step up onto my chair. A little bit unsteady. I rest my fingers around the plastic speaker. I smash my fist against the taupe drywall underneath it. My knuckles light up in pain. I pound my fist into it again and again. The crunching, brittle, hollow shudder. My vision fills with black fuzz. I feel the chalky drywall give way and yank out the speaker's TOTALNoise Cable. The skin on my index finger caught on a nail in the wall and it's dripping bright red blood. I don't have wirecutters or anything, so I dig into the cable with my teeth. I'm able to rip through its hard rubber casing but can't snap the metal tubing beneath. The wiring is slick with my spit.</Pp>
<Pp>I climb back down into my chair. The migraine dot's swollen. It's obscuring a third of my vision. I feel like I'm being smashed by a planet and shot through the head. I sob. My chest shakes underneath me. I wipe my drippy eyes.</Pp>
<Pp>"It's going to be OK." I say it so only I can hear. I rest my head on my arms and close my eyes. My celly keeps rumbling louder. "It's going to be all just fine."</Pp>
