<p>Vivi__ unlocks the rusty family turboshed, reaches in, unzips something, unknots something, pulls out two helmets, and extends them toward us. “Put it right up on your head, like mine.” She exaggeratedly mimes her helmet application maneuver. “Right up on.”</p>
<p>Quimby31 starts putting theirs on. Mine smells like ancient head sweat. </p>
<p>I ask, politely, “Why do we need helmets?”</p>
<p>Vivi__ looks at me like I’m not too clever. “So you don’t pass away, DUH! Stuff is always falling from the sky.”</p>
<p>I fasten the helmet’s flexo-cords under my chin. I can’t smell the helmet anymore, so the stink must be absorbing into my scalp. “Really? What kinds of stuff?”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, the usual garbages. Craps. Canisters. Half-eaten corndog. Diaper. Knife. Crumpled up printed out scoops. Blocks of ice. Whatever the people up above want to chuck. Nuthin too bad. That’s life, they say.” She marches onward, swinging her torch, melting away the night. “Sometimes the sky sprinkles down stupendous treasures. Here are some examples. Brush, for my teeth. Teevee in box, half-cracked. Bag of delicious Froot Pop Ems, half of them left, yommy! Sometimes the charities give to us and the community at large. They give us mostly merchandise. Mousepads, cup koozies, branded pens, but also these sweaters I’m wearing, the machine which keeps grandpop alive, I already said the seesaw, and great big bottles of food.”</p>
<p>Quimby31 is making an impressed face. “That’s very admirable and generous of them.”</p>
<p>“Yah really nice. In return they film vids of us with their humongous cameras.”</p>
<p>“What sort of vids?”</p>
<p>“It’s a teevee program called ‘People Below: Completely Sad’ brought to you by Ha Ha Entertainment. Every <span class="t">*</span>week just before sundown. Now available to view. I get nervous. I try to act like myself. They always tell me to frown.”</p>
<p>It’s impossible for me to not notice the ants now. Their shiny bodies scurry left and right. Every now and then I hear one of em crunch beneath my shoe and feel their runny guts squirt out. Our breath puffs out like steam and freezes into tiny grains.</p>
<p>The high walls of the gorge fan out into a sprawling plaza packed with people. There’s a noticeable heat to their bodies as ours join the mix. Each member of the crowd is moving asynchronously from the rest, with a distinct destination, darting out of each other’s way.</p>
<p>Vivi__ swivels her arms in circles. “Pop hasn’t been in the past coupla episodes. He’s been gone working for lots of <span class="t">*</span>days. I miss him.”</p>
<p>Sweet and savory smells waft from street vendor booths. It’s hard to make out words in the chatter of everyone. Ultradef screens glow at much too high a wattage over every square inch of the twisted rusted cramped skyscrapers lining the edge of the square. They’re illuminated with vivid, high-definition advertisements featuring text dancing and glistening across images of desirable products. Exits are to the right and left.</p>
<p>Quimby31: “What does he do for work?”</p>
<p>We weave to the right of a woman carrying a saggy, human-sized bag of Graip Froot syrup and to the left of two tall hairy men pounding each other with their fists. I narrowly slip through unpounded and unstained. We follow a ziggy zaggy path to the left exit.</p>
<p>“He turns a crank. Like this—” (she grimaces and cranks her balled up fists around a horizontal axis) “—but for reeeally long! No one knows what the crank is cranking. He says they don’t let him sit down or take a breather. He comes home and his face looks like this.”</p>
<p>Her eyes droop with fatigue. Her pupils are unfocused, like they’re looking but not finding. Her sapphire eyes glimmer in the lantern light. I am unnerved.</p>
<p>Me: “I’m really sorry to hear that.”</p>
<p>“It’s OK. I’m just sharing.”</p>
<p>There’s a raised platform in the center of the plaza adorned with silver statues bathing in golden light. I can infer that each statue in this shrine represents a corporation involved in the foundation of Stinky Town, such as: a super-sized drill bit for Crunch Ecodrilling, a vortex for TOTAL Corp, and an open toothy mouth for Ha Ha Entertainment. They’re the cleanest objects I’ve seen in a twentyleap. It must be someone’s occupation to clean them.</p>
<p>I’ve been crafting a little piece of humor for the past couple <span class="t">*</span>minutes. It’s finally ready: “For a place called Stinky Town, this place doesn’t smell half bad!”</p>
<p>No response so they must’ve not heard me. Glad I got that down in the log ha ha. I gently nudge Quimby31’s shin with my boot. “How are you?”</p>
<p>“Well, this night has been pretty annoying obviously. No offense.”</p>
<p>“None taken. What’re you reading?”</p>
<p>“Well, I finished reading all the facts. Now I’m skimming the opinions about the facts.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Good progress.”</p>
<p>“I think it’ll be a few <span class="t">*</span>hours yet until the opinions about the opinions start getting published.”</p>
<p>“Have I ever told you that I like your hairstyle?”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I’m not sure you ever have. Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Yah, no problem. I’m trying to work on my mentality. I think I’ve been acting like a pile of snart tonight. And that’s not OK, you know?”</p>
<p>“There’s always room to improve.” They slide their celly into their torso pouch. “But was complimenting my hairstyle just a mentality improvement exercise for you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Pretty sure I just thought it’d be a good thing to say.”</p>
<p>	The nighttime murk closes back in as we leave the warmth of others. The cliff walls are jagged and immense. I can’t imagine living all the way down here. I’d feel so trapped. I’ve lost sensation in my nose and ears. My eyes hurt from staying open. </p>
<p>	Vivi__ stops walking. “It’s only a bit farther. I wanna go home.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much for your help,” I say. “Super good job!”</p>
<p>“OK you’re welcome.”</p>
<p>Quimby31 lifts a marble out of their pant pouch. “Please take this as a gift. It’s a marble but it looks like the world. Isn’t that special?”</p>
<p>“Why would I want that? It’s a piece of crap. We need gold.”</p>
<p>“OK, uh…” </p>
<p>They search their pouch and dredge up a few hunks. I would give some too but all my ingots are back at my cubby. </p>
<p>She accepts the donation. “I need the helmets back too.”</p>
<p>We unclip and hand over the headgear.</p>
<p>“Thankya. Nighty night!” </p>
<p>She bows and exits into the shadows.</p>
