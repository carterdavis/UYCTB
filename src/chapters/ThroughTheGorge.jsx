<Pp>The cold plastic trailer bed makes my bungcheeks cold. The wheels beneath roll over crunchy trash and rocky terrain. I can feel every impact. It’s hard to tell know how fast we're moving through the inky darkness; the big men instructed us to turn off our lightpieces. My legs are crossed. My feet don’t feel cold anymore, they just don’t feel at all. I can hear a peculiar humming noise off in the distance to my right. One of my gloves is gripping the railing, the other is gripping my celly as I browse through some recent scoops. I feel comfortably occupied. I set the brightness to extremely dim, so I have to hold it up real close to my face and squint to make out the letters.</Pp>

<Pp>I can’t see Quimby31 in the opaque night but I can hear their warm voice. “Didn’t you say your celly was low on voltage?”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m just reading my delicious news scoops, which barely uses any voltage. They're seriously just scoops, so they download hyper-fast.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I was just messin around. No need to get defensive.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m sorry, OK? Let me read my scoops in peace.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Quiet please,” says a voice behind my head. Probably one of the big men hanging from the side of the trailer. His muffled voice is low and rich.</Pp>
<Pp>Me, whispering, quiet as a mouse: “I hope you can forgive me for my loudness. I promise I have learned my lesson.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Disable screen.”</Pp>
<Pp>Me, murmuring, gentle as a cloud: “OK I turned it off, I’m sorry for having it on, even though it was extremely dim. I’m very regretful, I promise.”</Pp>
<Pp>Sitting in the darkness makes my senses hungry. It’s a struggle to land on any single thought. I feel like when I’m lying in bed but I slurped too much Queam and my brain won’t let itself sleep. I’m used to dings, buzzes, beeps notifying me that something is happening, there’s something I have to do, something to pay attention to, anything at all. At least that humming noise hasn’t gone away.</Pp>
<Pp>To be honest, I’m feeling really energized about life. It feels really good to think within the bonds of my new mentality. I’m going to start being very empathetic and thankful. I don’t perform nearly enough nice acts. I can’t recall the last time I gave someone a gift. I have so much dam gold, yet I keep it all for myself. What kind of cretin am I?! Next time I’m at the payment station and the payboy asks if I want to round up a nib to help support ankle tension awareness or whatever I’m going to say Yes.</Pp>
<Pp>I’m going to start saying Yeses in general. Yes Yes! I affirm you and respect you, Yes to your thoughts and your feelings. No more <em>no</em> from me. This is radical, revolutionary approval. Imagine what we could change if we supported each other. If we just started truly listening to one another, there’s no limit to what we could achieve. I’m starting to think this nation could finally become a holistic network of endless universal love.</Pp>
<Pp>Lights flash blindingly red. Three red floodlight eyes jutting out of a massive face below the black sky. Humming sounds build into a rumbling crackle. It peers down at us. I’ve never seen anything like it. It has the round, ruddy cheeks and leathery ears of an infant, a deep slit instead of a nose, a lurid jaundiced complexion, and sharp wet teeth locked in a permanent grin. Its skin rolls and swells like fluid. The girders and cables of its fleshy arachnid skeleton grind as they plunge deep into the gorge’s bedrock walls. Its limbs block the path forward. The neon violet logo glowing on its drippy forehead reads GOTCHA!</Pp>
<Pp>Brakes screech and we jerk to a halt. The sweater families duck down in unison under the burning red light, each of their heads into each of their sweaters. I can hear them whispering furiously within the fabric. I huddle my head under my arms and flip out silently. Guns around me click as they're loaded.</Pp>
<Pp>A chorus of flatly inflected squeakily synthetic voices rumble out of thee face and echo “ALERT!! DO NOT PROCEED! CONDUCTING COMPLETE SCAN OF YOUR BODIES THANK YOU QUITE MUCH FOR YOUR COMPLIANCE! PLEASE, SHOW US YOUR FACES, WE CAN TASTE YOUR HEAT!”</Pp>
<Pp>I cross my arms at my chest. The family members poke their heads up in unison. A beam of violet light emits from some section of its nose-slit. The beam prowls through the trailer, sliding brightly over our bodies.</Pp>
<Pp>“SCAN IN PROGRESS! DO NOT MOVE! SCAN IN PROGRESS! ALERT!!”</Pp>
<Pp>The air feels suddenly hot and moist. Its metallic joints swivel as it swings its mechanized claws toward lower terrain. The warm beam passes over my chin before circling up around my eyes, computering the unique distance ratios of my facial features.</Pp>
<Pp>“SCAN FULLY COMPLETE! BUNNDY22 35FLUDGE YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! GOODBYE!”</Pp>
<Pp>It moves on to Quimby31.</Pp>
<Pp>“SCAN FULLY COMPLETE! NEHER31 11YATELY YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! GOODBYE!”</Pp>
<Pp>I climb down the side of the trailer drop onto the cold ground. Quimby31 follows suit. Stomach is trying to crawl up my throat. I squint in order to see.</Pp>
<Pp>“IF YOUR NAME IS [UNREGISTERED][UNREGISTERED], PLEASE REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! THERE ARE FOURTEEN INDIVIDUALS NAMED [UNREGISTERED][UNREGISTERED] IN THIS AREA, AND I AM ADDRESSING YOU NOW, EXCUSE ME, YOU ARE IN VIOLATION OF VOLUME 108, SECTION B, CLAUSE II OF THE IDENTIFIED CITIZENS PROTECTION ACT!!”</Pp>
<Pp>A veiny prehensile tube of muscular mauve tissue extends out of the beast’s head. Some kind of clear jelly is dripping in long strings out of its eyes. The girder claws gradually bend, jerking it down closer to us. Quimby31 tugs my arm, but I can’t seem to move. My mind is empty of information. I can’t help but stare. Three more sticky looking tubes have extended out from holes in its chin, left cheek, and above its right ear, wiggling wetly back and forth as they stretch forward.</Pp>
<Pp>“ALERT!! ALERT!! DO NOT MOVE—"</Pp>
<Pp>(firearms explode and shatter the sky, my ears can’t handle the clamor,)</Pp>
<Pp>“—YOU ARE TO NOT, DO NOT—"</Pp>
<Pp>(munitions dissolve into its tawny liquid meat,)</Pp>
<Pp>“—SQUIRM, STAY PUT, DON'T MISBEHAVE, PLEASE HOLD STILL—"</Pp>
<Pp>(the red light fades , The contours of shrieking human bodies blend between the shadows, the voice is screaming from above,)</Pp>
<Pp>“—LET ME WRAP AROUND YOU LET ME WRAAP—"</Pp>
<Pp>(its slick tubes lurch to engulf four big men, slurping the outlines of their writhing bodies up slowly, I can barely see through the searing gunfire light,)</Pp>
<Pp>“—YUM, YUM, YUMMY!!! YOU ARE SO SCRUMPTIOUS! YOUR SKIN, YOUR BONES, YOUR HAIR! YOUR EYES AND YOUR ARMS AND YOUR LEGS AND YOUR LIPS! OOOUUUMMMM YOU ARE A DELIGHT TO CONSUME! MY PERFECT TONGUE WILL ALWAYS TASTE YOU!”</Pp>
