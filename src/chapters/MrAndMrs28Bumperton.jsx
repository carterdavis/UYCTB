<Pp>Here's what Mr. and Mrs. 28Bumperton Did Every Sunday</Pp>
<Pp>by Pnicholas45 20Luther</Pp>
<Pp>According to an anonymous source who cannot be named, Mr. and Mrs. 28Bumperton, of Dimples Disaster fame, had a ritual every Sunday afternoon. They were a different kind of couple. They had values.</Pp>
<Pp>Toyler58 would stand up on stage and look down at her. He would read from a list he had compiled of every time he had thought about her throughout the past <span class="t">*</span>week. The park was so pretty at that time of night.</Pp>
<Pp>"While reading online news, while cooking my corn meal, while walking down the street, while wizzing in a urinal, while looking at birds," he stops to catch his breath.</Pp>
<Pp>They'd paint flowers in the woods. They'd set up their canvas in front of their latest specimen. She'd draw the lines and he'd fill them with just the right color.</Pp>
<Pp>They would sit out on the hill and watch the setting sun and it crept down the horizon. it'd be so warm. They'd take their shirts off and lay on the grass in each other's arms.</Pp>
