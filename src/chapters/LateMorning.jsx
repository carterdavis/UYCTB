<Pp>My skull is throbbing. I squeak my way out of my sweat-slick rubber bedcloth. Late orange light filters through the blinds. The world outside is still clicking along. My hair is greasy underneath my wig and my tummy has some gripes. Drool's encrusted from my lips all the way down past my knobby chin.  My mind is racing with empty thoughts. After a commendable amount of effort I am now out of bed. I spend a kind of long time trying to choose which socks to wear; I go with the brown ones. I'm standing in front of the mirror wearing a flop top with some polyurethane dungarees.</Pp>
<Pp>All my facial bruising cleared up overnight. My features are completely unrecognizable. They're very pointy and symmetrical now. I now look extremely sexy and attractive like a guy from an advertisement. I don't think I ever used to be "ugly" necessarily but now everyone will choose to look at me. Feels crazy. I try doing some sassy poses, such as ones where my rear is popping out and I'm glancing back over my shoulder with a coy expression, or those in which I flex all my arm muscles to look scary and powerful, or I smile and raise my broad shoulders in a graceful shrug, looking quite radiant and carefree.</Pp>
<Pp>I check my celly. It's 3:15bt on Activeday, which means I overslept by more than 36 <span class="t">*</span>hours. That's ridiculous. I hope the birdies are OK, they must be so hungry. That also means I missed morning mass. Alas, there were so many important things I wanted to do on Busyday, but I need to accept that I blew it. Dammit! Shoot! Holy mackerel, what a load of bullcrap.</Pp>
<Pp>Hey pretty birdies! Hey sweet friends! I understand that you're starving, but you need to stop shrieking at me. I'm getting your food. Look! Here's your food! I'm pouring your individually designated servings as we speak. Mmm, I bet this'll taste so good! Please, my head hurts so freaking bad. Every time you screech it's like nails dragging across my brain. Don't you realize how much pain you're making me feel?? PLEASE!</Pp>
<Pp>And OK, the thing is, of course I'm aware that my words will never make them quiet. I really can't blame them. If I were locked in a cage for most of my waking <span class="t">*</span>hours I think I'd scream my head off too. I'm the sole provider for every single one of their needs. They need to be able to let me know there's an issue. I tried to train them, but they ended up training me. They're wild animals. I had no hope of ever controlling them. They choose what they want to do and when they want to do it.</Pp>
<Pp>Part of it's my fault; I feel strange about giving them treats every time they do something right. I still give them treats, but couldn't they develop their own understanding of good and bad without the promise of immediate benefit? I like to think they could. Those ideas exist and are expressed in all of us. We're all sewn by the same thread. But I get it. It's not like I don't understand. We are here together, and things go wrong.</Pp>
