<Pp>Remembering the Victims of the Dimples Disaster</Pp>
<Pp>by Greg98 92Stephephenson</Pp>
<Pp>[[ The [...] parts are going to be obscured by in-world ads ]]</Pp>
<Pp>Mort62 79Shmanderson awoke from rest this past foggy Thursday morning unaware that it would be his very last. His dear wife, Charlene59, gingerly placed a plate of artificial eggs atop his whirring iron lung machine and slowly fed him heaping spoonfuls. I will never forget the way she looked at me as she spoke about him. Egg would occasionally get stuck in his throat and she’d have to carefully pat him on the head in order to dislodge the chewed chunks.</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>“I’d never expected to lose him so soon,” she confided in me tearfully in a celly conversation this Respectfulday. “I was even sewing him a new pair of lungs. They're in the fridge, if you want to take a look at them. They're still sticky.”</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp> “Every time I look at his face I expect his eyes to move.”</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>Toyler58 28Bumperton’s passing was graceful and dignified. He fell into cardiac arrest mere <span class="t">*</span>minutes into a friendly pickup game of kronky hoop with his five athletic sons and his five kind daughters. He died doing what he loved, surrounded by the ones he loved. His own eyes rolled backwards into his own head and ropes of his fresh drool splattered against the kronky ball.</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>His eldest son wiped his red eyes. “I shouldn’t have hugged him so hard. I bet that’s what gave him the arrhythmia in the first place.”</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>“Is daddy in Hell now?”</Pp>
<Pp>[...]</Pp>
<Pp>The families ask that you not harass them on social media programs. Mr. 79Shmanderson has been lovingly taxidermied and made into a piece of high-end furniture. Mr. 28Bumperton has been cautiously burned and used to grill a savory meal. The 79Shmanderson family is currently running a LetsPayThem campaign, raising gold to open a factory that crafts miniature pewter statues of their patriarch. It ends in two <span class="t">*</span>months.</Pp>
