<Pp>I get anxious in the nasty winter nighttime. I ruminate about bad things until I feel freaked out, and then I keep doing it. Like for example, the acceptance ceremony for my Dimples offer was kind of messed up. I still think about it a lot.</Pp>
<Pp>Basically on my first *day I met with Veronica72 97Snoat in the fifth floor Hiring Chamber. She'd explained to me that every new Dimples hire signs the same gilded contract on their first *day. The chamber was freezing cold, apparently so the ink would dry better. I had not yet seen the contract, but I had been given a pretty comfortable quill to sign it with.</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you have any questions?" She was wearing an excited grin. "This should be really quick, no biggie."</Pp>
<Pp>"No questions yet." I mimed my signature in the air with the quill. "Can you pass me the contract?"</Pp>
<Pp>Her long fingers were perched atop the gilded papper. "Do you agree to it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?" I set the quill down.</Pp>
<Pp>"Pick up your quill."</Pp>
<Pp>"Can't I read it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't treat the quill like that. Hold it carefully in your little rodent hands. Why would we ever show you the contract if you weren't going to agree to it?"</Pp>
<Pp>"That was not a kind thing to say about my hands, and I really don't think I'm being out of line here. I just want to know what stuff I'm agreeing to." I shivered and watched my breath mist dissipate.</Pp>
<Pp>"The text of this contract is private Dimples intellectual property.  If you cannot agree to sign the contract, we will retract our offer." Her eyes were cold and empty.</Pp>
<Pp>"But if I agree to sign, you'll let me read the contract?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You either sign it or you don't. The terms aren't up to you. Everyone signs the same contract. That's just the way it works here. Besides," she points at the people standing on the transparent ceiling, "do you think all those people up there would've signed a bad contract?"</Pp>
<Pp>I imagined having to move back home, jobless, sitting on yellowed furniture, listening to the clicking sound of the circular fan in the sweltering nasty summer heat, wondering how much longer we'd be able to afford grandma's purple pills, feeling myself grow endlessly downwards like the roots of a weed. I picked up the quill, gently this time. "OK. I'll agree to sign."</Pp>
