  <Pp>"I'm having trouble replicating the bug." I can't help but sound meek. I straighten my shirt and shift my weight on the beanie bag. I'm feeling pretty down and bad about myself. It's so hard to focus on my work. I can think of way too much to think about. I trace functions calling other functions, instantiating reference models that sort through bundles of streams of function references, looping around and around like a whirly wheel, so many structures operating in fragile dependent tandem. I've been tracking the metadata of a VORP request through an especially wrinkly equality matrix. As variables equal-bounce from node to node they leave behind a unique trail.</Pp>
  <Pp>The glyphs are blending together and I'm mostly just scrolling. It's hard to carefully follow the flow of logic when its ramifications could very well possibly include another human freaking death any *second now and I'm sweating like a bovine. My eyes unfocus to the ticking of the clock.</Pp>
  <Pp>Here's a confession: I'm not very good at this. I can do this, I'm able to do this, but this is really not what I'm good at. I know it's my job and all but I'm not some sort of talented brain wizard expert.</Pp>
  <Pp>I was never allowed to play with building blocks as a kid. They were banned in my whole neighborhood. Our local Prayer Dome management was uncomfortable with how easily kids, upon succumbing to their darker whims, could erect them into "pagan obelisks." I never learned good spatial reasoning. I can't twist a 3D shape around in my head and understand how it looks from all angles. I can't visualize complex data models or simulate sequences of logical decisions without making my head feel hot. Why should I have to think that way? Other critters don't have to. I wish I was some kind of species where I could just fly around and eat bugs all *day. Now wouldn't that be nice actually?</Pp>
  <Pp>My tone is skeptical: "Are you totally 100% sure they were running the most recent version?"</Pp>
  <Pp>Nug20 nods. "Both crashes transpired less than four *hours after updating."</Pp>
  <Pp>I drag a window for an electrocardiogram simulation in circles on my screen. The heartbeats are following the right rhythm. Th-thump, th-thump, th-thump. Much slower than mine, but chances are I'm hyper. Sometimes the beats per *minute increase to simulate the bot patient getting excited or agitated. This simbot is named Cormy__ __Shnabbett, age 63, a short hairy old man with a heart problem. It's sitting on a bench in the sun, squinting to watch a blockbuster film on his celly. I'm trying to blink an eyelash out of my eye. I feel empty and fainty and kinda like there's a thin layer of sticky transparent crud covering my skin. "Everything looks fine so far."</Pp>
  <Pp>Nug20 doesn't look up. He continues hammering away at his keys. They have dynamite haptic feedback and rumble the table each time they're pressed. Each tap sounds like the tiniest thunderstorm. When he's really concentrating he makes little rhythmic grunting noises under his breath. His hair is long and greasy and hangs down past his shoulders. It thins as it reaches the top of his head, where he's bald for a three inch radius. His cheeks are long and dangly, and the shape of his skull is clearly visible. I don't know where he worked before this role. I don't know much about him at all. But I'm aware that he has no intention to respond. He won't say a word.</Pp>
  <Pp>I receive a zoip from Jumper56. In case you're wondering, that "zoip" acronym stands for "Zero Overhead Interchange [Proprietary]." It's the main chat protocol we use around here.</Pp>
  <Z d={1} u="j56">jumper56ok : howdy!! would you be able to help me with a snag?</Z>
  <Z d={15} u="j29">funguyjim29 : sure what's the snag?</Z>
  <Z d={30} u="j56">jumper56ok : i'm getting some ERR::DisequalizedIntToInt thing now all of a sudden</Z>
  <Z d={40} u="j29">funguyjim29 : oh, that just means one of your numbers is set to another number.</Z>
  <Z d={45} u="j29">~ : like the interpreter thinks  5 = 9 or something like that.</Z>
  <Z d={60} u="j56">jumper56ok : oh ok. so how do i fix it then?</Z>
  <Z d={73} u="j29">funguyjim29 : you need to trace the error trail</Z>
  <Z d={82} u="j56">jumper56ok : might you be able to help me?</Z>
  <Z d={92} u="j29">funguyjim29 : yah, we'll work on it tomorrow</Z>
  <Z d={97} u="j56">jumper56ok : sick. thanks</Z>
  <Pp>Nug20 continues his silence. I'm tired and hopeless. The sky is dark. A thin bit of light peeks through the smoky clouds and dances on the glistening lawn. Nug20's nameplate is etched in a stately white serif letters against a maroon background. They read NUGGORT20 43DUNC - TECHNO FREEK."</Pp>
  <Pp>He does a slight frown whenever he's thinking hard. He squints at his screen. "I got pulled over by the GOTCHA! Guys last night."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Is that right?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"Speedster's rump didn't shut right, was slamming up and down when I was going over bumps. Folks behind me must've spied some of the tools I got back there."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Oh gosh. How'd it go?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"Guys let me off with a warning tattoo. They're laughing, slamming my face against the hood. I'm 32 *years old, you know? I have kids. And that needle's hot."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Jeez, nuthin but jeez. That's so bad. I'm really sorry to hear that." I'm not sure what to say. He's never mentioned his tools before. "I'm glad that you're OK."</Pp>
  <Pp>He presses the spacebar four times in a row. His throat bump rolls up and down like he's swallowing. He coughs like he's summoning a loogie. "Not any big deal or nuthin."</Pp>
  <Z d={1} u="j29">funguyjim29 : are you doing anything tonight ?</Z>
  <Z d={12} u="j29">~ : I was thinkin itd be fun to watch a slamdown at the arena</Z>
  <Z d={19} u="j29">~ : or purchase dizzy drinks at a gulping den</Z>
  <Z d={25} u="j29">~ : I just want to do something.. interesting and entertaining !</Z>
  <Z d={35} u="j56">jumper56ok : i value the invite jim29!!</Z>
  <Z d={42} u="j56">~ : how ever i think i will stay and work on this error.</Z>
  <Z d={53} u="j29">funguyjim29 : yah understood noo problem</Z>
  <Z d={65} u="j56">jumper56ok : but i'm having a party next activeday</Z>
  <Z d={71} u="j56">~ : to celebrate tweensies! you're invited =:~)</Z>
  <Z d={80} u="j29">funguyjim29 : wow very cool !!</Z>
  <Pp>Everybody within about a three sector radius celebrates this cool holiday called Tweensies. As nasty winter shifts into nasty summer, there's about a *week of fantastic warm sweet temperatures, and amidst this tween time a great merriment can be shared. This *year Tweensies starts on Activeday. I'm pretty pumped.</Pp>
  <Pp>"Nug20, I'm not making any progress." I shiver atop my beany bag. "At this point I think I'm just gonna put out a hotfix first thing tomorrow morning."</Pp>
  <Pp>He looks over at me. "You can't put out a fix tonight?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"I poked around through all of the VORP Requests. None of them were throwing errors. I've read through the lines I modified in the update three times already. It doesn't make any sense. I don't know what more to do."</Pp>
  <Pp>"Sometimes, you must quadruple-duple check."</Pp>
  <Pp>"I really have to go home and feed my birds."</Pp>
  <Pp>He appears taken aback. "You're serious?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"I would never let them go hungry."</Pp>
  <Pp>A short pause. Clacking keys.</Pp>
  <Pp>He pushes his glasses up again. "Can I ask you something?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"Yah."</Pp>
  <Pp>"What do you want out of life?"</Pp>
  <Pp>"Hmm, I don't know. I'm sorry. I'll think about it and get back to you. I'm trying really hard to do the right thing."</Pp>
  <Pp>"I know how this goes, Jim29. Listen to me." He's being so scoldy right now. His eyes bug out of their sockets. "This will not be good. You are making a big mistake."</Pp>
  <Pp>I stuff my computering device into my bag. "I'm sorry. I wish I could keep working. I really have to go."</Pp>
