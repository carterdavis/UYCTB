<p>It’s the middle of nasty winter and the outside sucks the wind out of my chest. It’s been in the negative twenties since December but it’s just broken into the negative thirties. My eyes get stiffer the longer I’m outside. Blood’s left my extremities and I can’t feel my toes. I left my speedster in section A2 southwest. I try to think about being cozy-warm and home. It’s about a nine <span class="t">*</span>minute walk.</p>
<p>Still walking.</p>
<p>Almost there!</p>
<p>“Good evening, Tulip.”</p>
<p>That’s my speedster’s preferred name. It has big round cheeks, long floppy ears, and a light, boyish voice that reverberates within its cabin. It lifts its sleepy eyes and smiles. “Good evening, Jim29! I love you.”</p>
</Pp>

<p>I open the back hatch and pull out my defroster. Its blade glows red hot as I super-heat the thick blurry layer of frost off the front windshield. Tulip’s bulbous eyes gaze up at me as it giggles. The wind roars and slices my skin. It hasn’t snowed for <span class="t">*</span>weeks; it’s been too cold. The concrete of the parking complex is weathered and stained with frozen earth. My eyeball temps are dropping fast. They’re getting thick and gooey.</p>
<p>My celly wirelessly connects to Tulip’s speakers as I twist my thumb in its fuzzy ignition socket. TunesJam has generated a customized playlist of wimp rock songs based on my recent listens. I’ve been getting really into wimp rock lately. Sonically, it mixes the passionate, wry lyrical approach of twerp punk with the sentimental heaviness of dweeb metal. It’s warm music that feels right when everything else feels wrong. You know what I mean? Ha ha. I think you get what I mean. I like basically all kinds of music, but some things just sound really, really good to me.</p>
<p>Tulip’s speedster model has a low-power DynoHeater; it’s still pushing out cold air and so that’s why I’m blowing on my raw hands, rubbing em together. <div class="chapterSong"><LazyAudio src="assets/It's So Cool To Be Afraid.mp3" loop={true} bg="#332063" fg="#D6CB40" /></div> The first song on this mix is called “It’s So Cool To Be Afraid” by the Comfortable Boys. One of my favorites. I have a feeling that you might really love it.  It has some really relatable lyrical observations about how it feels to be a normal freaking guy just livin life. I’m gonna crank the heat up a bit.</p>
<p>The lanes merge with one another. Three at once into one.  The guy in front of me is a lot heavier on the brakes than he needs to be. I tail him more than I should. I should probably slow down.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#332063, #D6CB40, #332063, #332063">
<p>I sink into my chair.</p>
<p>A street above me is packed with people going home, leaning over their wheels. Exhaust pours out of their crudpipes. I look down at the fuel gauge. Running somewhat low on coal. The nearest coal kiosk is three twentyleaps away. The traffic is dense. I’m on tier two of the highway. Speedsters are above and below me. I can see slight shimmers of the moon through gaps in the concrete behind clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>I scream as loud as I can. I really rip my vocal cords. I scream again, until it echoes in my head. My body shakes and my ears explode with my own noise. I ease forward with my foot off the coal pedal. Advertisements are lit up on the LED undersides of the streets above. We’re nearing the end of flashlight season. Or torch season or lantern season, depending on your regional dialect. All of the ads feature swanky designer lightpieces. I close my eyes and shiver. My fingers are stiff at the joints from clenching.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#332063, #D6CB40, #332063">
<p>I crawl out of the rightmost lane and onto the exit-entrance ramp. Ramp sign says 30tlph but I hug the turn going 39. Another lane merges in from the right. I put on the brakes and let a teal speedster with a long nose and a bushy moustache merge in. The speedster’s rump is covered in shiny stickers: a squarish one that says “BUSINESS is PLEASURE”, a triangle one that says “There are only three genders.” and one shaped like a thumbs up that just says “WORKING.” They’re crawling into a helix roundabout far below the speed minimum. I practically donk into them, cuz I’m going a normal speed, not crawling like some sniveling puttywad who probably smells like rotting garbage and has never been embraced.</p>
<p>I roast coal and lurch into the turn lane. I get a look at him, and let’s just say, he looks like a sicko. I wave and get his attention. He’s got a rat face. He must not take enough suppies because his hair is falling out. His nose is literally shaped like a bowel movement.</p>
</Pp>
<Pp bg="#332063, #332063, #D6CB40, #332063">
<p>I get him to roll his window down. I’ve got my head out the window. I’m serious. We’re driving side by side down the helix. He’s got this look of fear on his creepy little face. I lock eyes with him and shout “Learn to drive, you <em>chimpnut!”</em></p>
<p>I swerve off onto an entrance-exit ramp as track 2 of my personal TunesJam mix starts, a slow-burner titled “Untitled 1 (Song About Frustration).” Nort71 56Nitchell of the seminal wimp rock band We’ll Learn Each Other’s Names squeals like a swine and goes into this register that I really love. There’s so much emotion in the way his voice cracks, you know? The instrumental is so powerful and soothing. Gotta keep my hands on the wheel. The highway winds around and around.</p>
