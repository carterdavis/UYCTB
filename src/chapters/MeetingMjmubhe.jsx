<Pp><Typing>The ladder is jammed stuck at the bottom against a clumpy brown mound</Typing> swarming with more thick ants. I lower my shaky foot onto its frozen surface. The lantern illuminates a well-stomped trail down the mound's slope into the bed of the gorge. My muscles ache with wiggly tiredness. There's not even a breeze. Yellowing bones from unknown bodies jut out of the terrain. Some are spiky, some are round.</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 drops down. "So this is terrace Star-Circle-Octagon." They blow warm air on their raw hands. "There should be an Ascent Station about a twentyleap and a half north from here."</Pp>
<Pp>"Shh. Listen to that."</Pp>
<Pp>"Listen to what?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Nuthin at all, I mean. It's so quiet down here. Isn't it amazing?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I have tinnitus. The ringing just sounds especially loud."</Pp>
<Pp>"I didn't know that. Is it genetic? Or from exposure?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Congenital, passed down from my dad. Kind of a generational thing. Can we start walking again? I really want to be home."</Pp>
<Pp>"Yah no, that definitely makes sense, absolutely."</Pp>
<Pp>A twentyleap isn't that far, and a couple is literally only a bit farther. My thoughts are feeling quiet like a church. The mound is icy-slick as it slopes downward. I slip once and nearly plop on my bottom. Neher31 leans forward like they're there to catch me but not enough that they'd be able to break my fall; it's more of a symbolic gesture.</Pp>
<Pp>A young girl is sitting among a pile of grey rocks in the distance. A torch is burning on the ground near her criss-crossed legs. As we walk closer, she appears to be wearing four or five layers of hooded sweatshirts and a metallic helmet that looks to be one size too big. She is humming a song from an advertisement to herself. I can't fully remember the product it was an advertisement for, but it's a nice song. The thick overlapped sweatshirt sleeves make her arms look very wide and stumpy. She places her hands on the side of her face and shrieks. It is bloodcurdling. Once she's done, she says to us, at a more respectable volume, "Honie honie honie honie. Zeep zorp flarfny snert."</Pp>
<Pp>I stop walking and whisper "Oh my gosh what the hell."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 shoves me lightly, whispers back "That's gorgespeak. You've never heard about gorgespeak? Don't you read lots of online scoops?" They squat down to look into her eyes and enunciate very slowly. "Hello," (waving at the girl) "do you..." (pointing at the girl) "speak..." (motioning to their mouth) "Central Standard?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes. Hello." She slides her eyes around in her sockets in an effort to thaw them. Her voice is raspy and her accent is very round and bright, like that of a newscaster. She speaks with dignity and bravado. "Well the truth is, everybody calls me Mjmubhe__."</Pp>
<Pp>"What are your registration numbers, Mjmubhe__?"</Pp>
<Pp>"She's unregistered," I butt in. "That's obviously not a federal name."</Pp>
<Pp>"You can talk to her then, since you're mister world's hugest genius."</Pp>
<Pp>"My tone was rude. I'm sorry."</Pp>
<Pp>"Don't apologize so much. It's not a big deal."</Pp>
<Pp>"What am I supposed to do then? I just want to resolve the--"</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__: "To tell you the truth, Grandpoppie is sick, and dying, dying very quickly. Will you help him? Toss me a bone, wouldja?"</Pp>
<Pp>There isn't much of an expression on her face. The top layer sweatshirt she's wearing says "KILL://PUREGORE.SNUFF" and underneath, "#1 Beheading Catalog In The Cybersphere. LIVE Vivisections Streaming Now, Slit Throat, Organ Removal, Ripped Apart Bodys [sic] Free Trial Sign Up Now, No Bull$*!t, Just Dismemberment." They make me recall the halcyon gore *days of my youth, staying up late on the computerior watching sites like Pure Gore, Chop Time, and TubeMurder.</Pp>
<Pp>I actually didn't realize there's electricity down here. That means her grandpap is probably using a Dimples machine. I hold the lantern away from me so she can't see my face wounds. "Can I make a deal with you, Mjmubhe__?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Indeed. Good deal."</Pp>
<Pp>"If I treat your poppie, will you guide us through this scary gorge?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Yes OK."</Pp>
<Pp>"Where is he?"</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ clutches her torch and wobbily stands. "He's sleepin like a baby back home. I am thankful thankful as I could ever be, love your kind help. Stupendous." Her stride is loping and fairly brisk. She guides us over jagged outcroppings only half visible in the murk. The ground is menacing, littered with ants, meaty decaying skeletons, rusty personal blades, supplement bottles, fool's gold, and sharp half-eaten cans of frosty golden creamed kernels. I really have to watch my step.</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 is still shivering quite a lot. I'm a little nervous about their comfort. "What do you like to do for fun, Mjmubhe__?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Grandpoppie always tells me no playtime. I am always working. He is the wisest man I've ever met. He says if there ain't quite enough gold for bill payment, we gettin' chopped up by the big terrible nutjob freaks reb rabba zorp and made straight into sandwich meat, is what he always tells me."</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31: "What do you do for work?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I play *day in and *day out on the seesaw."</Pp>
<Pp>"Jim29 and I both love the seesaw too."</Pp>
<Pp>"Oh, how I hate the seesaw. I have nary a soul to seesaw with. All alone. Not even anyone to talk to, besides momma of course. Alas if we are lacking seesaw power, we cannot pump water, zilch, might as well be pumping dust, understand? The special seesaw is a water pumping kind, and a gift from the entrepreneur charity. How stupendous." She stumbles over a threatening crag. "Grandpoppie needs brand spanking new water all over his body, at all times, every *day."</Pp>
<Pp>"Mjmubhe__, may I ask you a question?" I ask. "What is your grandpop's ailment?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Poor man stepped on a nest of small crawling ants. Next thing you know, they chewed him head to toe, munch munch crunch. And guess what, body is now filled up to its brim with venom. At least running water soothes. We have so many seesaws but no ant exterminator. What's the deal with that." She pushes open a mossy iron door. Her cave home is warmly lit and messy and dirty. There is a large fire burning in an alcove set into the wall on my right and I wonder how it's ventilating. A woman who I presume is Mjmubhe__'s mother walks into the light. She is frail and wrapped in a soiled full-body scarf, which I discern through my formidable speed reading skills is embroidered with the fulltext details of an already-held sweepstakes to win tickets for an all-expenses-paid luxury virtual cruise through the tropical North. As an unregistered, it's not like she would've been eligible anyway. Her eyes are wet and red-rimmed. It looks like she must have done a lot of crying a bit ago. She glares at Mjmubhe__, places her hands on the sides of her face, and shrieks.</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe places her hands once more on the sides of her face, and shrieks.</Pp>
<Pp>The mother does not appear to be happy. "Honie krinky dink?" She says her words with great resentment. "Zibby dipadap vooop vip vrump."</Pp>
<Pp>"Gromemo momo spebbo zimt eee yoop," explains Mjmubhe__, sounding calm and deferential. "Yaba Grandpoppie bong." She turns to us. "Follow."</Pp>
<Pp>The floor cords lead toward another iron door. Mjmubhe__ struggles to swing it ajar with her short padded arm while still clutching a very active torch, but she needs no assistance. The door creaks resonantly and the room behind it is filled with the dim blue and pink glow of lifesaving technology, whirring noises, and muffled human groaning. Mjmubhe__'s grandfather is floating in a plexi-glass chamber all wrinkled and wiry, his naked skin narcotizing and decaying in blackened patches that look like diseased burns, tubes running in and out of his nose and his mouth and his anus, his eyes locked shut in suffering, his limbs wriggling and dancing in a seemingly unsuccessful attempt to calm or punish his firing nerves. The only light in the room is coming from the Dimples logo on his All-In-One Life Sustainment System Z20 Extreme, which I suspect is pearl-white under its brown layer of accumulated sediment. I started work at Dimples around the time we were shipping out the Z23 Extreme, but this model is still a few months away from total obsolescence.</Pp>
<Pp>"Do you have the 40-digit PIN number for this machine?"</Pp>
<Pp>She blinks at me. "Explain PIN?"</Pp>
<Pp>"It should have been on the box. Do you have the box?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I sleep on that box every night. Very sturdy."</Pp>
<Pp>"The specific box that your grandpop's equipment came in? From Dimples? I need the PIN number to run diagnostics."</Pp>
<Pp>"No no no." Her tone is frustrated. "I have simply have no PIN!"</Pp>
<Pp>Passwords for Dimples machines are allowed to be a maximum length of 32 case-insensitive alphanumeric characters, excluding any special symbols. If I just had the PIN I could boot past the password screen and reset the machine, but instead I'm left to doing guesswork. I type in all my default password ideas: "1234", "123456789", "abc123", "dimples", "123dimples"...Each incorrect guess is met with a startling "DOINK!" noise from the system's speakers. The keyboard is grubby and sticky with dirt and bug slime. Grandpoppie thrashes in the water like he's getting eaten up by piranhas. I keep typing and pressing return. "DOINK! DOINK! DOINK!"</Pp>
<Pp>Neher31 puts their arm on my shoulder. "It's OK if you can't fix it."</Pp>
<Pp>"DOINK! DOINK! DOINK! DOINK DOINK!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I'm sure I can fix it. I just need to get access."</Pp>
<Pp>"DOINK!"</Pp>
<Pp>"Can you get access without making that hellacious racket?"</Pp>
<Pp>"DOINK DOINK!"</Pp>
<Pp>"I don't think there's any other way. It's a system noise, so I can't turn the volume down. I'm sure the engineers had a reason for making it so loud."</Pp>
<Pp>I take more time to think between my guesses. Still: "DOINK!...DOINK!...DOINK!..."</Pp>
<Pp>I forget to even type anything in before hitting return. It makes a beautiful boingy boing noise and a loading screen pops up, informing me that it is Scavenging For System Dump, Please Sit Still A Few *seconds. The account's password must've just been blank. I didn't even know blank passwords were allowed. The loading animation depicts a very small man pushing an even smaller rock up a little pipsqueak hill. He just can't quite seem to push it all the way to the top without losing his grip. The stone rolls very quickly all the way back down over and over and over in fluid vector animation. I wish it would just show a percentage instead. *minutes pass by.</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ is walking around in a circle, stepping one foot in front of the other, arms outstretched for balance. She must have placed her torch in a wall mounted sconce. Neher31 is on her celly and scrolling, eyes darting up, down, zigzagging around.</Pp>
<Pp>The loading man finally rolls the stone all the way up to the hill's apex. He looks triumphant before instantly fading into the black void of the command line.</Pp>
<ViewScreen num={1} />
<Pp>This might look like just a bunch of hogwash to you, and it's OK if it does. The command line (or the console, or the shell) is like a conversation portal ON the computering device WITH the device, spoken in its special computational tongue. You can tell it to do things and ask it questions. It is good at talking so long as you know just what to say. Anything can be done through the console, which is a thrilling idea to ponder. But however, if you don't know the language, it might as well be a big old pile of baloney!</Pp>
<Pp>At the beginning of our exchange, the shell delivers its ritualistic greeting. One very interesting factoid is that the text of that greeting was generated by our data steward using a proprietary Dimples module called Ear2Ear. System engineers designed the module to help Deward translate condensed logical network data into Central Standard-encoded human language. On occasion it'll glitch out and get totally messed up, but it works most of the time and the console supports a lot of handy commands. I don't think Deward likes me, and that's fine, because I detest Deward. It tries to personally tailor its text to suit how it thinks I think, but, well-intentioned as it may be, it has this strange abrasive personality, and it speaks in halting unpleasant phrases, and I still have no clue why it colors certain words the way it does. Most of all I hate it when Deward tries to bust out some slang.</Pp>
<Z d={15} u="j56">jumper56ok : what's all this about this bug of yours killing people?</Z>
<Pp>On the first line with the arrows (>> means the spot where I can start typing) we ask what files are in the current directory. Some stock commands require certain "courtesy keywords" -- these were introduced by Dimples as a way to try to reduce hardware abuse rates at the company. Apparently over the *years it grew common for some of the stronger, taller employees to respond to a failing test or confusing error by crushing their computeriors' screens between their biceps or furiously body-slamming them into the floor. *years have passed and hardware abuse rates haven't dipped at all, not even slightly, but now if we were to remove the keywords it'd break a million or so different scripts we have running in the server barn, so, here I am, still having to tell Deward PLEASE and THANKS. There are a handful of folders in this directory and a couple files. Dimples installations always get dumped into the "default" folder, I guess because no one ever bothered to rename it. There also seems to be a duplicate install of Dimples here only because the installation workers we have at the company are smelly, aloof ding dongs morbidly fried out on scary recreational chemicals.</Pp>
<Pp>That wasn't very nice of me to say. That's not the kind of thing I think very often. On line 2 we CLIMB INTO the /default folder. I like to imagine the computering device hoists itself up into the folder with a rope and a snug harness. Note my courteous tone, THANKS. It's really hard to concentrate with Mjmubhe__ vocalizing another advertisement anthem, this time singing the lyrics for the SplishTime Broop, a half-broom/half-mop with a wide, enchanting smile and a bulbous chin (the lyrics for the commercial's song chant cheerfully, over a bed of warm electric maracas, <em>Swoop swoop swoop/Quick as a Broop/All the grinky and goop/Yabba dabba dee doop</em>) and Neher31 is still muttering quake statistics under their breath. Mjmubhe__ is doodling a lovely 3D-printed plexiglass cottage tucked between the cement supports of a blocked-off expressway ramp, tracing her unsteady lines with a black surgical marker on the back of a red-lettered medical debt bill. Neher31's taps the upper-left corner of their screen, then the bottom-right, then the upper-left again. Their celly is a sleek, stylish model, wide and long enough to really get lost in.  "...and that's not even counting any children. Heavens, can you even imagine?..."</Pp>
<Z d={12} u="j56">jumper56ok : i know it's not fully your fault or whatever but good jesus.</Z>
<Pp>On the following line, we ask the computering device again, PLEASE, what files are in this folder. Is this making sense? Am I moving too fast? You can be honest. I just think maybe this is important, and I wouldn't want things to get confusing. I hope I'm not being rude. Let me know if you have any questions, OK. I just get worried sometimes.</Pp>
<Pp>Lastly, ultimately, we EXAMINE state.dump. This is where Dimples Z20 plops all of the incoming data from the equality network. This data composes an incomplete, temporary snapshot of the application's present status. All that junk gets formatted in DynoBracket, and if you're not already accustomed to such an old, crusty encoding it can be pretty challenging to visually parse. My advice is to just look at it like descending levels of containers, sort of like how we use parentheticals. It's a structure with depth, describing tiers delimited by ugly brackets. It's interesting that the filters didn't let any of Mjmubhe__'s grandpa's name through, but I guess that's just kind of how it goes sometimes. It doesn't look like the system considers that an error, only a nuisance to keep in mind. The real issue is down lower, with the variable CURVE_QUOTIENT. The bad news is that this is certainly an instance of my bug, and I really don't want to think about the full extent of what that means. The good news is that I found the problem, and grandpa floating in the tank will be able to live a bit longer. If this were any normal variable, I could access its data in the command line with the reference STATE.PHARMA.CURVE_QUOTIENT, but this variable contains what are commonly called "impossible digits."</Pp>
<Z d={15} u="j56">jumper56ok : i'm sorry. i wasn't being very empathetic</Z>
<Z d={27} u="j56">~ : i can't solve this error, jim29. is there any chance you could help me?</Z>
<Pp>For the sake of full disclosure, I don't have a sub-surface understanding of what impossible digits are. Their existence is a bit of a mystery, and I'm only even aware of them because I read so many good scoops. As far as I know, some scientists blame their proliferation on the collision of higher-dimensional hyperstatic cuboids, whereas others argue that they're just a curious side-effect of thermomagnetic bloating. I don't know what I believe, and I don't want to mislead you, OK? Maybe you've heard how they're formed, and you can tell me if you want. The point is, CURVE_QUOTIENT contains impossible digits, so its current value is inaccessible. Introducing those kinds of digits into the datascape could lead to hardware malfunction, so the system returns a nasty error instead. I'm not sure where that crud data is being generated, but if you recall line 495 in intensity-and-dosage.tangle:</Pp>
<Pp>UNFRACTIONATE(0 ≥ STATE[PHARMA[CURVE_QUOTIENT]] ≤ 1);</Pp>
<Pp>that indicates that CURVE_QUOTIENT's value is expected to be a rational number equal to 0, 1, or somewhere in between em both. The tricky part is, the data currently ascribed to CURVE_QUOTIENT both exists and doesn't exist, stuck in an unique halfway realm of impossibility. The only way to interact with it is to overwrite it.</Pp>
<ViewScreen num={2} />
<Pp>"Alright Mjmubhe__, I think this machine will work better now."</Pp>
<Pp>She stands up from her doodling. "Pop is happy and kicking?"</Pp>
<Pp>Her grandfather's wrinkled body is still writhing in the water. I have decided that I will not tell her that it seems like my mysterious mistake made him sicker. "The machine got turned off because of some kind of error. I'm pretty sure the error is fixed now. He'll be getting more medicine."</Pp>
<Pp>"And so, you mean, he's OK now?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I hope so. That's the thing about medicine, about health and life in general, y'know? You just have to hope. I work on machines like this, though, and I'm going to work hard to make sure that they run better for people like your grandpop."</Pp>
<Pp>She slowly nods a couple times.</Pp>
<Pp>"I completely understand if it's too much to ask, but could your mom possibly show us the way to the nearest Ascent Station?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Momma does not go out."</Pp>
<Z d={15} u="j56">jumper56ok : i haven't even left the office. i'm still here.</Z>
<Z d={23} u="j56">~ : my brain can't even think anymore. Is there any way that you could help me?? please???</Z>
<Pp>"Would you be able show us the way? Would that be too much to ask?"</Pp>
<Pp>"You assisted Grandpop, which means I will lead you down the path." She tapes her bill-doodle to the dimly lit wall.</Pp>
<Pp>"Alright. Awesome, sweet, thanks."</Pp>
<Pp>"Did you hear that more than hundred thousand are confirmed dead because of that quake?" Neher31 is hugging their celly against their chest. "That's unbelievable."</Pp>
<Pp>I do a variation on the typical kind of shrug. "Yah, I guess."</Pp>
<Pp>"What do you mean?"</Pp>
<Pp>"I guess I just think it does sound fairly believable."</Pp>
<Pp>Mjmubhe__ exits the room and I follow.</Pp>
<Pp>"Maybe this is a dumb time to be cynical?"</Pp>
<Pp>"Forget it."</Pp>
<Pp>She's in the kitchen, speaking quietly to her mother. Her mother starts to sob. She lifts Mjmubhe__ up in the air and squeezes her tight against her bosom. Her tears are red like runny blood. They streak rivulets down her face and drip to the floor as she heaves, shaking in anguish, squeezing tighter and tighter. She lowers Mjmubhe__ to the ground, smiles, and covers her face.</Pp>
<Pp>Outside is still frigid. There are a few different distant sirens blaring, mainly shocking screams and whistles.</Pp>
