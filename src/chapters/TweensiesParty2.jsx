<Pp>It sounds much less creepy down here, as I’d hoped. The lamp glow is like orange noon light. Jumper56 is sipping a canister of Brain Drill wearing a squiggle skirt, an assortment of neon bangles, and her usual hard hat. She and some other person are engaged in smiling conversation. It seems like it’s a fairly good chat, I wouldn’t want to interrupt.</Pp>
<Pp>The walls down here are speckled with personal photographic images printed onto glossy papper and carefully trimmed into various creative shapes. I have to squint to make out the scenes in the dimness. They primarily depict quiet moments in interior spaces like arms around shoulders, hands holding one another, candid laughter, muffins steaming in the tray, or an angled view of pink sunset clouds through a dusty window. I’m not in any of them, but I’m not taking it personally; it doesn’t seem like she snaps any work photos. I myself only have a few hundred pics saved to my mindchip since my last wipe. I’m terrible at knowing what bits of my life are worth recording. It sounds like their chat is winding down.</Pp>
<Pp>I intrude. “Hey thanks for throwing this party! I’ve been having such an awesome time, dam!!”</Pp>
<Pp>She smiles wide. “Well that is really dope to hear dude!” We tap wrists. “The thing is, you must forgive me, but, my memory is so so bad. What’s your name again?”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s me! Jim29! This is how I look now forever, ha ha. Pretty <em>strange</em>, huh? Life sure loves to throw us for a loop.”</Pp>
<Pp>She’s peering at me with narrowed eyes. She seems either mortified or disgusted. “Your voice is the same, yah. What the hell my man…seriously oh my god!! Why did you mess up your face?”</Pp>
<Pp>I’m having trouble maintaining my smile. “Dimples did this to me. They changed my registered name, too. Whole new identity. Bet I’m not even supposed to be talking to you. I’m technically not a person anymore.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yeesh. Hmm. Darn. Uh. Jeez.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Sorry, not to be papa frowny!”</Pp>
<Pp>“No it’s OK!”</Pp>
<Pp>“Alright cool. You fix that buggy yet? The <Code>Disequalization</Code> one?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Nop. I mean actually I fixed that one, but like, my solution yielded two more errors. The deadline to fix is Honestday afternoon. I have been working on em like a numbskull. Is there any possible chance you could help me troubleshoot tomorrow maybe?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Ah…um…I was considering calling in sick.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Please Jim29, I’m really really nervous. It would mean a lot to me.”</Pp>
<Pp>“OK, OK. I’ll help you. I’m sure we’ll figure it out, don’t worry.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh thank you, thanks! I mean it from the very bottom of my heart.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Also I’m sorry for not responding to your messages on Loyalday. I went to the coast with a friend, and then Earthquake Travis happened, which was not very convenient at all! Shut down all the choo choos and we couldn’t get back.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Oh my gosh! That sounds so fricking scary!”</Pp>
<Pp>“It would be an understatement to say it was the pits. We had to traverse the full diameter of Terrace Star-Circle-Octagon to get back home. One thing’s for sure, there’s a reason why they call it Stinky Town! Peee-yoo!! Ha ha.”</Pp>
<Pp>Her face drains into blankness. “Don’t say stuff like that.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Stuff like what?”</Pp>
<Pp>“The region’s true name, translated into Central Standard, is ‘Red Valley.’ ‘Stinky Town’ is like, a super hurtful altitudinalist epithet. Does that make sense?”</Pp>
<Pp>“OK, I’m sorry. It’s not like there’s anything down there besides ants and garbage.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Actually I’m from there. And my family still lives there. Do you think I’m garbage?”</Pp>
<Pp>I jut my lips into a classic pout, lower my chin, point my eyes up, and speak like a cute baby. “I’m sowwy!! Pwease fowgive me??”</Pp>
<Pp>“You’re not being funny. You’re being a bigot.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I apologized! What more do you want? I’m SORRY! I never meant to hurt your feelings. I’ve just been having a really really hard time lately. I’m learning to accept that my life won’t ever be the same again. And in the meantime I’m just trying to do what makes the most sense, and maybe that just so happens to mean me acting like a messed up moron every now and again. I’m an engine burning chemicals with no control over my destination. But you’re right, nuthin’s been funny for <span class="t">*</span>years and <span class="t">*</span>years and <span class="t">*</span>years. I shouldn’t have tried.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Dam, you are pretty quick to exonerate yourself completely!”</Pp>
<Pp>I’m breathing too fast. “C’mon. Give me a break. You’re not being fair.”</Pp>
<Pp>“It’s so creepy how little regard you show for other people. Like yah, you’re in an awful situation, I get that for sure, totally, but even if your old life is over, you are still a rich, educated, healthy young guy with a grotesquely lucratively easy and need I not mention WORTHLESS job. Not like—"</Pp>
<Pp>“The work I do isn’t worthless. I’m sure I generate a big profit. They’re making lots off of me.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I mean worth in terms of improving the lives of others. But see like, that’s also part of the problem with people like you. You don’t understand how much gold they have up there. No one does. It’s an inconceivable amount. So instead you look down on those with the least. Do you know how hard I had to work to get your exact same job? I’m swimming in debt and I doubt I even make half your salary.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Have you talked to your supervisor about seeking a pay increase?”</Pp>
<Pp>“You say that like I’m an idiot. Of course I have. I’m doing everything I can.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m seriously not trying to make you mad. I just wanted to have a nice conversation.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You know how I’m always typing at work? And how that always bothers you so much?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yop.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I’m an AdMonkey reviewer. I watch an ad, then type a review of it. I post the review on Drip and get ten gold nibs.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I didn’t know you were on Drip! Are you sipped to my account?”</Pp>
<Pp>“No, it’s only for my job. Just a quick source of supplementary income. Like an <span class="t">*</span>hour ago I wrote a review about some kind of dizzy drink called Goat Butt Extreme. I’ll never drink it again, but now I can afford a meal at the Food Dome with friends tomorrow. I’m gonna review this Brain Drill too. Those extra bits of gold allows me to live like a normal person, so it’s worth it.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Seems like a weird way to use your time.”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yah? All I want is for you to consider for even one instant that, perhaps, your perspective is not crucial, your existence is not central, and the depth of your suffering is not unique. So many people I love and cherish are struggling to make ends meet down there, in as you call it ‘STINKY TOWN.’ They never stop working, but the price of corn keeps rising, and I have to send em literally eighty percent of my monthly gold so they don’t starve. Eighty percent!! Of course I’d rather live someplace where the slightest seismic perturberation won’t bury me alive, where I could open up any windows and breathe sweet fresh morning air. But I can’t indulge in vain luxuries at the expense of those I love. Not an option! Unacceptable! They are good, honest people, and you are mocking them because it’s easy. Because you’re empty!! And, and, don’t let me forget the biggest hugest most massive thing, which is that—" she points her finger right in my face, “—which is that you’re a MURDERER. You have KILLED people. But apparently that’s fine, no consequences for you. Just gotta use a nickname now, darnit, oh well, no biggie boing boing. Meanwhile my nephew is in lockup for parking on the wrong side of the street. Kinda weird how that works out, huh!!”</Pp>
<Pp>“What on earth!! Man. Where is this coming from? I’ve only ever been nice to you.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You need to figure out what kind of person you want to be.”</Pp>
<Pp>“This might be the last conversation we ever have. You realize that, right?”</Pp>
<Pp>“Yop.”</Pp>
<Pp>“You know what kind of person I am.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I thought I did.”</Pp>
<Pp>“STOP it! Please!! Just chill out. I’ll do better. I swear. Give me a chance.”</Pp>
<Pp>“I don’t need people like you. There are <em>so many</em> people like you. Please get out of my house.”</Pp>
