<Pp>The video is only fifth in a series all about people choking on taffy. I've watched all four prior installments. This one's named "Taffy Choke Compilation 5: Zero Airflow Edition." His name is Morris34 and he has a big wad of Strawbberry taffy in his mouth on a wooden roller coaster. First bump and he's wheezing. His face is bright red. He whacks his arm against the railing.</Pp>
