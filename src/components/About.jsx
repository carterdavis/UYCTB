        <h2>About The Book</h2>
        <p>Until You Continue To Behave is a super maximalist tragicomedy about guilt and disconnection in a cartoonishly warped world, filled with illustrations, animations, and original music. I wrote/programmed it to transform my fear and disillusionment into something silly and beautiful. You can read the whole thing for free on this site, and a full-color paperback version available to order at UYCTB.STORE, with 100% of the proceeds going to Food Not Bombs.</p>
        <h2>About The Author</h2>
        <p>I'm a very nice young man who currently lives in Minneapolis. Besides writing and programming, I also do a lot of visual art and animation. I'll update this later, haha.</p>

        <p>Dana Telsrow did all the music for this project. His songs are funkier and spunkier than a punk and a skunk.

        <p>Celine Lavonne Bernard Robins edited the text of the book, and her notes made it so much better. You can follow her on <a href="https://twitter.com/CelineLavonne" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/celinelvbrobins" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
